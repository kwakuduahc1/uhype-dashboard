   abstract = {Background: Obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are worldwide epidemics that inflict burdens on both public health and health care costs. Self-management plays an important role in the proper management of these 3 chronic diseases, and in this context, mobile health (mHealth) can be a cost-effective self-management tool. Objective: The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of an integrative mHealth approach for obesity, hypertension, and T2DM on body fat, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels and demonstrate the clinical outcomes. The participants were patients aged 40 to 70 years who were treated for T2DM (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] above 6.0%) without insulin or hypertension and obesity, controlled with pharmacotherapy. Methods: This pilot study was performed using a controlled, randomized, 3-month, 2-period crossover design. A total of 37 participants were recruited from 2 university hospitals in South Korea. Integrative mHealth comprised 4 parts: self-measuring home devices for monitoring blood glucose and blood pressure; 2 smartphone apps, where one gathered lifestyle data, giving them feedback with health information, and the other provided drug information and reminders of the medication schedule; unmanned kiosks for official measurement of blood pressure and body composition; and web-based access to participants health information. Results: Data from the 32 participants were analyzed. Their mean HbA1c level was 7.5% (SD 0.8, ranging from 6.1% to 9.4%). Approximately 38% (12/32) of the participants had hypertension. BMIs of all participants except 1 were 23 kg/m2. The input rates of food intake and exercise to the smartphone app were very low (24.9% and 5.3%, respectively). On the contrary, the input rate of medicine intake was high (84.0%). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the input rate of taking medicine irrespective of whether the mHealth period was before or after the conventional treatment period (80.3% and 87.3%, respectively; P=.06). Among the 3 input functions of food intake, exercise, and medicine intake in smartphone apps, the input of medicine intake was a more helpful, easier to use, and better-designed function than the others. There were no significant differences in changes in body weight (-0.519 kg vs 0 kg), BMI (-0.133 kg/m2 vs-0.167 kg/m2), body composition (body fat-0.255% vs 0.172%), blood pressure (systolic-0.226 mm Hg vs-2.839 mm Hg), and HbA1c (-0.269% vs 0.009%) between the integrative mHealth and conventional treatment groups. However, in proportion to the elevation in the input rate of taking medicine, body fat mass (P=.04) and HbA1c (P=.03) were lower in the integrative mHealth group. Conclusions: Although smartphone apps can influence body fat and blood glucose levels, they have failed to show clinical improvement. A higher input rate of taking medicine was related to significantly lower body fat mass and HbA1c levels.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Non-communicable diseases impose a significant social, economic and health burden. Hypertension, the leading contributor to the global burden of disease and a growing public health problem worldwide, is one of the most serious non-communicable diseases. In Ethiopia, empirical evidence on the economic burden of hypertension is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the cost of hypertension and associated factors at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital, northwest Ethiopia. Patients and Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 442 adult hypertensive patients using a semi-structured questionnaire to estimate the direct and indirect costs of hypertension. The human capital approach was used to calculate indirect costs. A generalized linear model was fitted to identify factors associated with the cost of hypertension at a 95% confidence level and <0.05 p-value. Results: A total of 442, 56.3% female and 64.3% stage one hypertension patients were included. The total cost of hypertension was ETB 2510.32 ($91.72) ± 2152.80 (78.65) per patient per year; The direct medical and non-medical cost constituted 60.81% and 12.17% of the total cost of hypertension, respectively. Hospitalized (exp(b)=1.87, p<0.001), using multidrug (exp(b)=1.32, p<0.000), high socioeconomic status (exp(b)=1.41,p<0.000), college and above education(exp(b)= 1.35, p<0.016), government employment (exp(b)= 1.30, p<0.012), retirement (exp(b)= 0.71, p< 0.001) and co-morbidity (exp(b)= 1.20, p<0.004) were factors significantly associated with the cost of hypertension. Conclusion: The total cost of illness of hypertension is high, and direct medical cost has the highest component of the total cost of illness. Hospitalization, using multidrug, co-morbidity, attending college and above education, highest socioeconomic status and government employment were factors significantly associated with the high cost of hypertension. Therefore, prevention and early detection of complications and co-morbidity are essential to reduce hospitalization and the number of drugs to reduce the direct medical and indirect costs.},

   abstract = {The present study used harmonized data from eight studies (N = 28,891) to examine the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and resting systolic blood pressure (SBP). The study replicates and extends our prior work on this topic by examining potential moderation of this association by race and gender. We also examined the extent to which body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and smoking might explain the association between SES and SBP. Data were available from six race/gender groups: 9200 Black women; 2337 Black men; 7248 White women; 6519 White men; 2950 Hispanic women; and 637 Hispanic men. Multivariable regression models showed that greater annual household income was associated with lower SBP in all groups except Hispanic men. The magnitude and form of this negative association differed across groups, with White women showing the strongest linear negative association. Among Black men and Hispanic women, the association was curvilinear: relatively flat among lower income levels, but then negative among higher income ranges. Education also was independently, negatively related to SBP, though evidence was weaker for race and gender differences in the strength of the association. Higher BMI and WC were associated with higher SBP, and current smoking with lower SBP. Inclusion of these risk factors resulted in only a modest change in the magnitude of the SBP and SES relation, accounting on average about 0.4 mmHg of the effect of income and 0.2 mmHg of the effect of education—effects unlikely to be clinically significant. Further understanding of mechanisms underlying the association between SBP and SES may improve risk stratification in clinical settings and potentially inform interventions aimed at reductions in social disparities in health.},

   abstract = {Introduction Systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), a global public health problem and the primary risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, has a significant financial impact on health systems. In Brazil, the prevalence of SAH is 23.7%, which caused 203,000 deaths and 3.9 million DALYs in 2015. Objective To estimate the cost of SAH and circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH from the perspective of the Brazilian public health system in 2019. Methods A prevalence-based cost-of-illness was conducted using a top-down approach. The population attributable risk (PAR) was used to estimate the proportion of circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH. The direct medical costs were obtained from official Ministry of Health of Brazil records and literature parameters, including the three levels of care (primary, secondary, and tertiary). Deterministic univariate analyses were also conducted. Results The total cost of SAH and the proportion of circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH was Int$ 581,135,374.73, varying between Int$ 501,553,022.21 and Int$ 776,183,338.06. In terms only of SAH costs at all healthcare levels (Int$ 493,776,445.89), 97.3% were incurred in primary care, especially for antihypertensive drugs provided free of charge by the Brazilian public health system (Int$ 363,888,540.14). Stroke accounted for the highest cost attributable to SAH and the third highest PAR, representing 47% of the total cost of circulatory diseases attributable to SAH. Prevalence was the parameter that most affected sensitivity analyses, accounting for 36% of all the cost variation. Conclusion Our results show that the main Brazilian strategy to combat SAH was implemented in primary care, namely access to free antihypertensive drugs and multiprofessional teams, acting jointly to promote care and prevent and control SAH.},

Additionally, factors associated with regularity in treatment follow-up were also identified. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken in selected primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare settings between September, 2017 and December, 2018 in Islamabad, Pakistan. A structured data collection form was used to gather sociodemographic and clinical data of recruited patients. Binary logistic regression analyses were undertaken to determine association between regularity in treatment follow-up appointments and blood pressure control and to determine covariates significantly associated with regularity in treatment follow-up appointments. Results: A total of 662 patients with hypertension participated in the study. More than half 346 (52%) of the patients were females. The mean age of participants was 54 ± 12 years. Only 274 (41%) patients regularly attended treatment follow-up appointments. Regression analysis found that regular treatment follow-up was an independent predictor of controlled blood pressure (OR 1.561 [95% CI 1.102–2.211; P = 0.024]). Gender (OR 1.720 [95% CI 1.259–2.350; P = 0.001]), age (OR 1.462 [CI 95%:1.059–2.020; P = 0.021]), higher education (OR 1.7 [95% CI 1.041–2.778; P = 0.034]), entitlement to free medical care (OR 3.166 [95% CI 2.284–4.388; P = 0.0001]), treatment duration (OR 1.788 [95% CI 1.288–2.483; P = 0.001]), number of medications (OR 1.585 [95% CI 1.259–1.996; P = 0.0001]), presence of co-morbidity (OR 3.214 [95% CI 2.248–4.593; P = 0.0001]) and medication adherence (OR 6.231 [95% CI 4.264–9.106; P = 0.0001]) were significantly associated with regularity in treatment follow-up appointments. Conclusion: Attendance at follow-up visits was alarmingly low among patients with hypertension in Pakistan which may explain poor treatment outcomes in patients. Evidence-based targeted interventions should be developed and implemented, considering local needs, to improve attendance at treatment follow-up appointments.},

There is a lack of nationally representative data on incidence, causes, and predictors of 30-day readmission after hospitalization for hypertensive emergency. We used the 2013 to 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database to identify index hospitalizations for hypertensive emergency. Primary outcome was all-cause unplanned 30-day readmission. Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of readmission. There were 166 531 index hospitalizations for hypertensive emergency representative of 355 627 (SE, 9401) hospitalizations nationwide in 2013 to 2014. Mean age was 66.0 (SE, 0.14) years, and 53.7% were women. The overall incidence of unplanned 30-day readmissions was 17.8%. The most common causes of readmission were heart failure (14.2%), hypertension with complications (10.2%), sepsis (5.9%), acute kidney injury (5.1%), and cerebrovascular accident (5.1%). Noncardiovascular causes accounted for 57.9% of readmissions. We found age <65 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17-1.25; P<0.001), female sex (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.07-1.12; P<0.001), comorbid disease burden, substance use disorders, and socioeconomic risk factors to be significant predictors of readmission. One out of 6 patients hospitalized for hypertensive emergency had an unplanned 30-day readmission. Heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, and stroke were among the most frequent causes of readmission; however, over half of all readmissions were because of noncardiovascular causes.},

   abstract = {Background: There is a robust understanding of how specific behavioural, metabolic, and environmental risk factors increase the risk of health burden. However, there is less understanding of how these risks individually and jointly affect health-care spending. The objective of this study was to quantify health-care spending attributable to modifiable risk factors in the USA for 2016. Methods: We extracted estimates of US health-care spending by condition, age, and sex from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Disease Expenditure Study 2016 and merged these estimates with population attributable fraction estimates for 84 modifiable risk factors from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 to produce estimates of spending by condition attributable to these risk factors. Because not all spending can be linked to health burden, we adjusted attributable spending estimates downwards, proportional to the association between health burden and health-care spending across time and age for each aggregate health condition. We propagated underlying uncertainty from the original data sources by randomly pairing the draws from the two studies and completing our analysis 1000 times independently. Findings: In 2016, US health-care spending attributable to modifiable risk factors was US$730·4 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 694·6–768·5), corresponding to 27·0% (95% UI 25·7–28·4) of total health-care spending. Attributable spending was largely due to five risk factors: high body-mass index ($238·5 billion, 178·2–291·6), high systolic blood pressure ($179·9 billion, 164·5–196·0), high fasting plasma glucose ($171·9 billion, 154·8–191·9), dietary risks ($143·6 billion, 130·3–156·1), and tobacco smoke ($130·0 billion, 116·8–143·5). Spending attributable to risk factor varied by age and sex, with the fraction of attributable spending largest for those aged 65 years and older (45·5%, 44·2–46·8). Interpretation: This study shows high spending on health care attributable to modifiable risk factors and highlights the need for preventing and controlling risk exposure. These attributable spending estimates can contribute to informed development and implementation of programmes to reduce risk exposure, their health burden, and health-care cost.

A number of treatment options are available to control blood pressure. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of health services and self-care amongst people with hypertension and to estimate the out-of-pocket expenses associated with such health care use. A sub-study of the 45 and Up Study was conducted amongst 1300 individuals who had earlier reported a clinical diagnosis of hypertension in 2017. A total of 753 (57.9%) individuals with hypertension returned a completed questionnaire. In the last 12 month, for their hypertension management, 84% of participants consulted a doctor, 19% of them consulted an allied health practitioner and 9% of them consulted a complementary medicine practitioner. The average total out-of-pocket expenditure for hypertension-related health care was Australian $461.8 per annum, with an estimated Australian $941 million per annum if extrapolated to all Australians aged 55 years and over with hypertension. Older people with hypertension use a wide range of health services to control their blood pressure including conventional medicine, allied health and complementary medicine practitioners as well as various self-care practices. A substantial amount of out-of-pocket expenditure has been spent on hypertension care annually. Given the global health and economic burden of hypertension, there is an urgent need for more research exploring cost-effective management(s) for hypertensive patients.},

   abstract = {Background: Multivariate linear regression model is a reliable type of predictive analysis, which perfectly accord with the object of estimating and predicting the economic burden attributable to hypertension. Multivariate linear regression model can estimate how influential covariates are in predicting an explained variable, which variables are significant predictors of the dependent variable, in what way do they impact the outcome variable, and how the following trend will develop. Objectives This study aims to estimate the trend of inpatient and outpatient medical burden attributable to hypertension from 2011 to 2015. Method: Data for this study was from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) 2011, 2013, and 2015, a comprehensive and nationally representative survey of Chinese residents aged 45 and older. The sample sizes in 2011, 2013, and 2015 are respectively 17705, 18605, and 21095. This study uses a set of three multivariate linear regressions to estimate increments of outpatient and inpatient costs. Results: On average, the outpatient cost of medical treatment for hypertension is 9.84 yuan (95%CI: [3.33yuan, 16.35yuan]) per month. Further statistical evidence reveals that the outpatient costs attributable to HBP in 2013 and 2015 are not significant. The total cost of outpatient service and treatment in 2013 is 22.17 yuan (95%CI: [12.62yuan, 31.72yuan]), while the number in 2015 accounts for 23.43 yuan (95% CI [13.57yuan, 33.26 yuan]). Outpatient medical cost attributable to for female is 18.28(95%CI: [11.73yuan, 24.83yuan]) yuan. The cost of outpatient medical care without public insurance is 15.23 yuan (95%CI: [1.34yuan, 29.11yuan]). The outpatient medical cost attributable to a high-income level is 20.48 yuan (CI: [12.65-yuan, 28.31 yuan]). The cost of outpatient medical care attribute to the western population was 13.57-yuan (95% CI: [5.32-yuan, 21.83 yuan]) yuan. Education, marital status and agricultural or nonagricultural workforce are not significant factors for outpatient HBP. The average inpatient medical cost for hypertension is 184.56 yuan (95% CI: [104.29-yuan, 264.82 yuan]) per year. The total inpatient medical cost in 2013 is 213.92 yuan (95% CI: [96.16-yuan, 331.68 yuan]). The total inpatient medical cost in 2015 is 268.27 (95% CI [146.78-yuan, 389.77 yuan]) yuan. Inpatient medical costs attributable to HBP in 2013 and in 2015 are not significant. The inpatient medical cost attributable to non-agriculture population over agriculture population is 259.49 yuan (95% CI: [155.28-yuan, 363.70 yuan]). Patients who live without a spouse spend 247.67 yuan (95% CI: [144.38-yuan, 350.96 yuan]). Furthermore, those who are not covered by public insurance on average spend 269.38 yuan (95% CI: [98.20 yuan, 440.55 yuan]). Inpatient medical cost attributable to a high-income level is 183.08 yuan (95% CI: [86.59yuan, 279.57yuan]). For those who live in the western part of China, the mean expenditure on hospitalized treatment is 133.11(95% CI: [31.35yuan, 234.88yuan]). Noticeably, this is the area that is less well-off compared to the metropolises along the eastern coast. Therefore, it can be inferred that education and gender are not significant factors for inpatient HBP. Conclusion: Among the elderly population aged 45 and above in China, the medical expenditure on inpatient and outpatient services of hypertensive patients is significantly higher compared to other age groups. However, the incremental cost of hypertension remained stable while the incremental cost of total medical expenses increased gradually. Thus, HBP may be under control while comorbidities and side effects subsequently increase the medical cost. The sample characteristics chart tells us that HBP is a detection problem rather than treatment problem. Hence, specific demographic groups need to raise awareness of the medical condition.},

   abstract = {Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide. Owing to the widespread use of antihypertensive medications, global mean blood pressure (BP) has remained constant or has decreased slightly over the past four decades. By contrast, the prevalence of hypertension has increased, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Estimates suggest that 31.1% of adults (1.39 billion) worldwide had hypertension in 2010. The prevalence of hypertension among adults was higher in LMICs (31.5%, 1.04 billion people) than in high-income countries (28.5%, 349 million people). Variations in the levels of risk factors for hypertension, such as high sodium intake, low potassium intake, obesity, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet, may explain some of the regional heterogeneity in hypertension prevalence. Despite the increasing prevalence, the proportions of hypertension awareness, treatment and BP control are low, particularly in LMICs, and few comprehensive assessments of the economic impact of hypertension exist. Future studies are warranted to test implementation strategies for hypertension prevention and control, especially in low-income populations, and to accurately assess the prevalence and financial burden of hypertension worldwide.},

   abstract = {Health care harms too many patients, costs too much, and improves too slowly. Progress in improving value has been slow. Most efforts to eliminate defects in value have been piecemeal rather than systematic. In this article, the authors describe a framework for identifying defects in value and provide estimates for cost savings if these defects were to be eliminated. The authors then provide a framework for how health systems may work to systematically eliminate these defects in value. Finally, they provide an example of one academic health system that embarked on a journey to implement this framework and the initial results and lessons learned. In the current study, the authors found that: (1) the U.S. health system spends in excess of $1.3 trillion per year on suboptimal behavior; and (2) their organization was able to reduce the annual per-member-per-year cost by 9% over the course of 12 months by reducing specific defects in care. Although it is early in the journey and the framework is only 25% deployed, the authors believe that this model offers a hopeful path forward for improving value.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association, in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, annually reports the most up-to-date statistics related to heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular risk factors, including core health behaviors (smoking, physical activity, diet, and weight) and health factors (cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose control) that contribute to cardiovascular health. The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). METHODS: The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update. The 2022 Statistical Update is the product of a full year's worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. This year's edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population and an enhanced focus on social determinants of health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, vascular contributions to brain health, and the global burden of cardiovascular disease and healthy life expectancy. RESULTS: Each of the chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics. CONCLUSIONS: The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policymakers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.},

   abstract = {Background: Worldwide, high systolic blood pressure is the leading risk factor for deaths and disability-Adjusted life-years but has been historically under-detected. This study aimed to quantify differences between estimated and practice-detected prevalences of hypertension across English general practices, and to determine how variations in detected prevalence could be explained by population-level and service-level factors. Methods: Descriptive statistics, pair wise correlations between the independent variables and a multivariable regression analysis were undertaken. In the regression model, the outcome was detected hypertension prevalence, adjusted for estimated prevalence, person-related and disease-related determinants of illness and characteristics of general practices. Results: Detected prevalence was substantially lower than estimated prevalence (mean difference 16.23%; standard deviation 2.88%). Higher detected prevalence was associated with increased deprivation, increased non-white ethnicity and urban location. Lower detected prevalence was associated with larger list sizes, more general practitioners and being located in the South outside London. The final multivariable model's adjusted R2 value was 0.75. Conclusions: Substantial under-detection of hypertension is widespread across England. Independent of estimated prevalence, factors associated with greater morbidity and population density predicted higher detected prevalence. Identifying patients with undetected hypertension and coordinating care for these patients will require further resources and logistical support in community settings.},

   abstract = {Background - National heart failure (HF) hospitalization rates have not been appropriately age standardized by sex or race/ethnicity. Reporting hospital utilization trends by subgroup is important for monitoring population health and developing interventions to eliminate disparities. Methods and Results - The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to estimate the crude and age-standardized rates of HF hospitalization between 2002 and 2013 by sex and race/ethnicity. Direct standardization was used to age-standardize rates to the 2000 US standard population. Relative differences between subgroups were reported. The national age-adjusted HF hospitalization rate decreased 30.8% from 526.86 to 364.66 per 100 000 between 2002 and 2013. Although hospitalizations decreased for all subgroups, the ratio of the age-standardized rate for men compared with women increased from 20% greater to 39% (P trend=0.002) between 2002 and 2013. Black men had a rate that was 229% (P trend=0.141) and black women, 240% (P trend=0.725) with reference to whites in 2013 with no significant change between 2002 and 2013. Hispanic men had a rate that was 32% greater in 2002 and the difference narrowed to 4% (P trend=0.047) greater in 2013 relative to whites. For Hispanic women, the rate was 55% greater in 2002 and narrowed to 8% greater (P trend=0.004) in 2013 relative to whites. Asian/Pacific Islander men had a 27% lower rate in 2002 that improved to 43% (P trend=0.040) lower in 2013 relative to whites. For Asian/Pacific Islander women, the hospitalization rate was 24% lower in 2002 and improved to 43% (P trend=0.021) lower in 2013 relative to whites. Conclusions - National HF hospitalization rates have decreased steadily during the recent decade. Disparities in HF burden and hospital utilization by sex and race/ethnicity persist. Significant population health interventions are needed to reduce the HF hospitalization burden among blacks. An evaluation of factors explaining the improvements in the HF hospitalization rates among Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders is needed.},

   abstract = {Background and aims: Hypertension increases healthcare costs, but the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on these costs is unknown. This study explored the association between healthcare costs and CRF among hypertensive and normotensive men. Methods: We studied 9794 male subjects aged 58.5 ± 11.3 years from the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center, including 6413 with and 3381 without hypertension. CRF was classified into four age-stratified categories according to metabolic equivalents (METs) derived from exercise testing: low fit (4.6 ± 1.2 METs; n = 2481), moderate fit (6.6 ± 1.2 METs; n = 2412), fit (8.0 ± 1.3 METs; n = 2505), and high fit (10.8 ± 2.1 METs; n = 2396). Annual costs per subject were quantified over eight years. Results: Total annual healthcare costs were higher in subjects with hypertension ($34,794, 95% CI, 32,828 to 36,761) in comparison to non-hypertensive subjects ($30,221, 95% CI, 26,104 to 32,450) (p < 0.01). In hypertensive subjects, a graded reduction in annual healthcare costs was observed as CRF was higher; costs were $40,346 for low fit, $35,939 for moderate fit, $32,312 for fit, and $29,277 for high fit subjects (p < 0.001). For each 1-MET increase in CRF, annual costs per subject (USD) were $1752 (95% CI, −2476 to −1,027, p < 0.001) lower among those with hypertension and $1025 (95% CI, −2047 to −2, p < 0.05) lower in those without hypertension. Conclusions: Higher CRF is associated with lower healthcare costs in men with and without hypertension. The impact of CRF on healthcare costs is more striking in those with hypertension.},

   abstract = {Objective: Antihypertensives are the most used medication type in the USA, yet there remains uncertainty about the use of different antihypertensives. We sought to characterize use of antihypertensives by and within medication class(es) between 1997 and 2017. Patients and Methods: A repeated cross-sectional study of 493,596 adult individuals using the 1997–2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The Orange Book was used for adjunctive information. The primary outcome was the estimated use by and within antihypertensive medication class(es). Results: The proportion of individuals taking any antihypertensive during a year increased from 1997 to the early 2010s and then remained stable. The proportion of adults using angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) increased during the study period, while angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) increased until 2010 after which rates remained stable. Beta-blocker use was similar to that of ACE-Is with an earlier decline starting in 2012. Thiazide diuretic use increased from 1997 to 2007, leveled off until 2014, and declined from 2015 to 2017. Non-dihydropyridine CCB use declined throughout the study. ACE-Is, ARBs, CCBs, thiazide diuretics, and loop diuretics all had one dominant in-class medication. There was a clear increase in the use of losartan within ARBs, lisinopril within ACE-Is, and amlodipine within CCBs following generic conversion. Furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide started with and maintained a dominant position in their classes. Metoprolol use increased throughout the study and became the dominant beta-blocker. Conclusions: Antihypertensive classes appear to have a propensity to equilibrate to an individual medication, despite a lack of outcomes-based research to compare medications within a class.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertension is highly prevalent in the United States, affecting nearly half of all adults (43%). Studies have shown that pharmacist-physician collaborative care models (PPCCMs) for hypertension management significantly improve blood pressure (BP) control rates and provide consistent control of BP. Time in target range (TTR) for systolic BP is a novel measure of BP control consistency that is independently associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. There is no evidence that observed improvement in TTR for systolic BP with a PPCCM is cost-effective. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of a PPCCM with usual care for the management of hypertension from the payer perspective. METHODS: We used a decision analytic model with a 3-year time horizon based on published literature and publicly available data. The population consisted of adult patients who had a previous diagnosis of high BP (defined as office-based BP≥140/90 mmHg) or were receiving antihypertensive medications. Effectiveness data were drawn from 2 published studies evaluating the effect of PPCCMs (vs usual care) on TTR for systolic BP and the impact of TTR for systolic BP on 4 cardiovascular outcomes (nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, heart failure [HF], and cardiovascular disease [CVD] death). The model incorporated direct medical costs, including both programmatic costs (ie, direct costs for provider time) and downstream health care utilization associated with acute cardiovascular events. One-way sensitivity and threshold analyses examined model robustness. RESULTS: In base-case analyses, PPCCM hypertension management was associated with lower downstream medical expenditures (difference: −$162.86) and lower total program costs (difference: −$108.00) when compared with usual care. PPCCM was associated with lower downstream medical expenditures across all parameter ranges tested in the deterministic sensitivity analysis. For every 10,000 hypertension patients managed with PPCCM vs usual care over a 3-year time horizon, approximately 27 CVD deaths, 29 strokes, 21 nonfatal MIs, and 12 incident HF diagnoses are expected to be averted. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PPCCM compared to usual care on TTR for systolic BP in adults with hypertension. PPCCM was less costly to administer and resulted in downstream health care savings and fewer acute cardiovascular events relative to usual care. Although further research is needed to evaluate the long-term costs and outcomes of PPCCM, payer coverage of PPCCM services may prevent future health care costs and improve patient cardiovascular outcomes.},

The study took place in the Midwest United States. Results: Descriptive statistics were used to analyze acceptability data that included attendance and a brief investigator-generated questionnaire. Twenty women were enrolled. Sixteen participants attended all four sessions, all reported they intended to continue using the intervention and felt it fit within their culture, routine, and self-care practices. The estimated cost of conducting the intervention was $227.00 (U.S. dollars) per participant. Conclusions: The co-created health education intervention was acceptable. Given the dire need for cost-effective interventions to improve the adoption of health promoting self-care management behavior, to reduce the prevalence of hypertension in African Americans, the results of this study have implications for future research and practice.},

Data from 12 904 adults aged 18–95 years, available from the most recent nationally representative 2017–2018 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey were used. Hypertension was defined as having systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, and/or taking anti-hypertensive drugs to control blood pressure. Age-standardized prevalence of hypertension and management were estimated with direct standardisation. A multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression model with a robust variance was used to identify risk factors associated with hypertension and its awareness, treatment, and control. The overall age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 26.2% (95% CI, 25.5-26.9); (men: 23.5%, women: 28.9%). Among those with hypertension (n = 3531), 36.7% were aware that they had the condition, and only 31.1% received anti-hypertensive medication. The prevalence of controlled hypertension was 12.7% among those with hypertension and 43.6% among those treated for hypertension (n = 1306). Factors independently associated with hypertension were increasing age, higher body mass index, being women, having diabetes, and residing in selected administrative divisions. A declining trend of hypertension control was observed with increasing age and low education. Hypertension is highly prevalent (one in four) in Bangladeshi adults, while awareness, treatment, and control are low. Irrespective of the risks associated with hypertension and its management, programs to increase its awareness, treatment, and control should be given high priority in reducing hypertension prevalence and improving hypertension control in Bangladesh.},

In this study, we aimed to quantify the overall and marginal impact of favorable cardiovascular risk factor (CRF) profile on healthcare expenditure and resource utilization in the United States among those with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods and Results-The study population was derived from the 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Direct and indirect costs were calculated for all-cause healthcare resource utilization. Variables of interest included CVD diagnoses (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, dysrhythmias, or heart failure), ascertained by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification codes, and CRF profile (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, physical activity, and obesity). Two-part econometric models were used to study expenditure data. The final study sample consisted of 15 651 MEPS participants (58.5±12 years, 54% female). Overall, 5921 (37.8%) had optimal, 7002 (44.7%) had average, and 2728 (17.4%) had poor CRF profile, translating to 54.2, 64.1, and 24.9 million adults in United States, respectively. Significantly lower health expenditures were noted with favorable CRF profile across CVD status. Among study participants with established CVD, overall healthcare expenditures with optimal and average CRF profile were $5946 and $3731 less compared with those with poor CRF profile. The respective differences were $4031 and $2560 in those without CVD. Conclusions-Favorable CRF profile is associated with significantly lower medical expenditure and healthcare utilization among individuals with and without established CVD.},

   abstract = {Background: About 0.9 billion people in the world have hypertension. The mortality due to hypertension increased dramatically over the last decades. Healthcare professionals should support patients with hypertension to modify their lifestyle to decrease blood pressure, but an overview of effective lifestyle interventions is lacking. The aim of this study was to determine whether healthcare professional-led interventions on lifestyle modifications are effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Methods: A systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted. PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were searched for randomized control trials (RCTs) of interventions on lifestyle modifications of hypertensive patients which were performed by healthcare professionals (physician, nurse, pharmacist) and which reported blood pressure measurements. Papers were reviewed by two reviewers and analysed using Cochrane software Revman 5.4. In a meta-analysis difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (BP) was analysed. Results: In total, 34 clinical trials reporting on 22,419 patients (mean age 58.4 years, 49.14% female, 69.9% used antihypertensive medications) were included. The mean difference SBP was − 4.41 mmHg (95% CI, − 5.52to − 3.30) and the mean difference DBP was − 1.66 mmHg (95% CI − 2.44 to − 0.88) in favor of the intervention group vs usual care. Fifty-six percent of patients achieved BP control in the intervention group vs 44% in usual care, OR = 1.87 (95% CI, 1.51 to 2.31). Conclusion: Healthcare professional-led interventions were effective. Patients achieved almost 5 mmHg decrease of SBP and more patients achieved BP control. The results suggest that efforts are needed for widespread implementation.},

   abstract = {Background: Hypertension requires life-long medical care, which may cause economic burden and even lead to catastrophic health expenditure. Objective: To estimate the extent of out-of-pocket expenditure for hypertension care at a population level and its impact on households’ budgets in a low-income urban setting in Colombia. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Santa Cruz, a commune in the city of Medellin. In 410 randomly selected households with a hypertensive adult, we estimated annual basic household expenditure and hypertension-attributable out-of-pocket expenditure. For socioeconomic stratification, we categorised households according to basic expenditure quintiles. Catastrophic hypertension-attributable expenditure was defined as out-of-pocket expenditure above 10% of total household expenditure. Results: The average annual basic household expenditure was US dollars at purchasing power parity (USD-PPP) $12,255.59. The average annual hypertension-attributable out-of-pocket expenditure was USD-PPP $147.75 (95% CI 120.93–174.52). It was incurred by 73.9% (95% CI 69.4%-78.1%) of patients, and consisted mainly of direct non-medical expenses (76.7%), predominantly for dietary requirements prescribed as non-pharmacological treatment and for transport to attend health care consultations. Medical out-of-pocket expenditure (23.3%) was for the most part incurred for pharmacological treatment. Hypertension-attributable out-of-pocket expenditure represented on average 1.6% (95% CI 1.3%-1.9%) of the total annual basic household expenditure. Eight households (2.0%; 95% CI 1.0%-3.8%) had catastrophic health expenditure; six of them belonged to the two lowest expenditure quintiles. Payments related to dietary requirements and transport to consultations were critical determinants of their catastrophic expenditure. Conclusions: Out-of-pocket expenditure for hypertension care is moderate on average, but frequent, and mainly made up of direct non-medical expenses. Catastrophic health expenditure is uncommon and affects primarily households in the bottom socioeconomic quintiles. Financial protection should be strengthened by covering the costs of chronic diseases-related dietary requirements and transport to health services in the most deprived households.

   abstract = {Cardiovascular disease and its associated risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes are contributing to a large portion of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in the United States. Diet and lifestyle education have been shown to be beneficial in reducing cost, mortality, and morbidity associated with these diseases. However, the lack of implementation of diet and lifestyle tools into clinical practices and into hospital systems leaves much room for improvement. Obstacles such as poor physician education, financial concerns, patient preference, and social resistance to change have made it difficult to promote healthy lifestyle and nutrition practices throughout all aspects of health systems. Some hospital systems and hospital-based clinical practices have had important successes in creating prevention clinic models, implementing plant-based menus in their hospital systems, and incorporating intensive rehabilitation programs that will pave the way for more future change. This review describes the current deficits, obstacles, and innovative strategies for implementing lifestyle medicine into hospital systems.},

   abstract = {Objectives: There is inadequate information on the economic burden of hypertension treatment in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the societal economic burden of hypertension at selected hospitals in Southern Ethiopia. Methods Prevalence-based cost of illness study from a societal perspective was conducted. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were determined by the current WHO's recommended DALY valuation method. Adjustment for comorbidity and a 3% discount was done for DALYs. The data entry, processing and analysis were done by using SPSS V.21.0 and Microsoft Excel V.2013. Results: We followed a cohort of 406 adult patients with hypertension retrospectively for 10 years from September 2010 to 2020. Two hundred and fifty (61.6%) of patients were women with a mean age of 55.87±11.03 years. Less than 1 in five 75 (18.5%) of patients achieved their blood pressure control target. A total of US$64 837.48 direct cost was incurred due to hypertension. A total of 11 585 years and 579.57 years were lost due to hypertension-related premature mortality and morbidity, respectively. Treated and uncontrolled hypertension accounted for 50.83% (6027) of total years lost due to premature mortality from treated hypertension cohort. Total productivity loss due to premature mortality and morbidity was US$449 394.69. The overall economic burden of hypertension was US$514 232.16 (US$105.55 per person per month). Conclusion: Societal economic burden of hypertension in Southern Ethiopia was substantial. Indirect costs accounted for more than 8 out of 10 dollars. Treated and uncontrolled hypertension took the lion's share of economic cost and productivity loss due to premature mortality and morbidity. Therefore, designing and implanting strategies for the prevention of hypertension, early screening and detection, and improving the rate of blood pressure control by involving all relevant stakeholders at all levels is critical to saving scarce health resources.},

Long-standing disparities in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control among racial and ethnic populations exist in the United States. High-quality evidence exists for how to prevent and control hypertension and for the role nurses can play in this effort. In response to the 2020 Surgeon General's Call to Action to Control Hypertension, nursing leaders from 11 national organizations identified the critical roles and actions of nursing in improving hypertension control and cardiovascular health, focusing on evidence-based nursing interventions and available resources. Aims: To develop a unified “Call to Action for Nurses” to improve control of hypertension and cardiovascular health and provide information and resources to execute this call. Methods: This paper outlines roles that registered nurses, advanced practice nurses, schools of nursing, professional nursing organizations, quality improvement nurses, and nursing researchers can play to control hypertension and prevent CVD in the United States. It describes evidence-based interventions to improve cardiovascular health and outlines actions to bring hypertension and CVD to the forefront as a national priority for nursing. Linking Evidence to Action: Evidence-based interventions exist for nurses to lead efforts to prevent and control hypertension, thus preventing much CVD. Nurses can take actions in their communities, their healthcare setting, and their organization to translate these interventions into real-world practice settings.},

Additionally, factors associated with regularity in treatment follow-up were also identified. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken in selected primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare settings between September, 2017 and December, 2018 in Islamabad, Pakistan. A structured data collection form was used to gather sociodemographic and clinical data of recruited patients. Binary logistic regression analyses were undertaken to determine association between regularity in treatment follow-up appointments and blood pressure control and to determine covariates significantly associated with regularity in treatment follow-up appointments. Results: A total of 662 patients with hypertension participated in the study. More than half 346 (52%) of the patients were females. The mean age of participants was 54 ± 12 years. Only 274 (41%) patients regularly attended treatment follow-up appointments. Regression analysis found that regular treatment follow-up was an independent predictor of controlled blood pressure (OR 1.561 [95% CI 1.102–2.211; P = 0.024]). Gender (OR 1.720 [95% CI 1.259–2.350; P = 0.001]), age (OR 1.462 [CI 95%:1.059–2.020; P = 0.021]), higher education (OR 1.7 [95% CI 1.041–2.778; P = 0.034]), entitlement to free medical care (OR 3.166 [95% CI 2.284–4.388; P = 0.0001]), treatment duration (OR 1.788 [95% CI 1.288–2.483; P = 0.001]), number of medications (OR 1.585 [95% CI 1.259–1.996; P = 0.0001]), presence of co-morbidity (OR 3.214 [95% CI 2.248–4.593; P = 0.0001]) and medication adherence (OR 6.231 [95% CI 4.264–9.106; P = 0.0001]) were significantly associated with regularity in treatment follow-up appointments. Conclusion: Attendance at follow-up visits was alarmingly low among patients with hypertension in Pakistan which may explain poor treatment outcomes in patients. Evidence-based targeted interventions should be developed and implemented, considering local needs, to improve attendance at treatment follow-up appointments.},

   abstract = {A literature review of peer-reviewed articles published 2000-2019 was conducted to determine the types and extent of hypertension-associated productivity loss among adults in the United States. All monetary outcomes were standardized to 2019 $ by using the Employment Cost Index. Twenty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria. Nearly half of the articles (12 articles) presented monetary outcomes of productivity loss. Absenteeism (14 articles) and presenteeism (8 articles) were most frequently assessed. Annual absenteeism was estimated to cost more than $11 billion, nationally controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. The annual additional costs per person were estimated at $63 for short-term disability, $72-$330 for absenteeism, and $53-$156 for presenteeism, controlling for participant characteristics; and may be as high as $2362 for absenteeism and presenteeism when considered in combination. The annual additional time loss per person was estimated as 1.3 days for absenteeism, controlling for common hypertension comorbidities, including stroke and diabetes; and 15.6 days for work and home productivity loss combined, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. The loss from absenteeism alone might be more than 20% of the total medical expenditure of hypertension. Although the differences in estimation methods and study populations make it challenging to synthesize the costs across the studies, this review provides detailed information on the various types of productivity loss. In addition, the ways in which methods could be standardized for future research are discussed. Accounting for the costs from productivity loss can help public health officials, health insurers, employers, and researchers better understand the economic burden of hypertension.},

This study explored the association between healthcare costs and CRF among hypertensive and normotensive men. Methods: We studied 9794 male subjects aged 58.5 ± 11.3 years from the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center, including 6413 with and 3381 without hypertension. CRF was classified into four age-stratified categories according to metabolic equivalents (METs) derived from exercise testing: low fit (4.6 ± 1.2 METs; n = 2481), moderate fit (6.6 ± 1.2 METs; n = 2412), fit (8.0 ± 1.3 METs; n = 2505), and high fit (10.8 ± 2.1 METs; n = 2396). Annual costs per subject were quantified over eight years. Results: Total annual healthcare costs were higher in subjects with hypertension ($34,794, 95% CI, 32,828 to 36,761) in comparison to non-hypertensive subjects ($30,221, 95% CI, 26,104 to 32,450) (p < 0.01). In hypertensive subjects, a graded reduction in annual healthcare costs was observed as CRF was higher; costs were $40,346 for low fit, $35,939 for moderate fit, $32,312 for fit, and $29,277 for high fit subjects (p < 0.001). For each 1-MET increase in CRF, annual costs per subject (USD) were $1752 (95% CI, −2476 to −1,027, p < 0.001) lower among those with hypertension and $1025 (95% CI, −2047 to −2, p < 0.05) lower in those without hypertension. Conclusions: Higher CRF is associated with lower healthcare costs in men with and without hypertension. The impact of CRF on healthcare costs is more striking in those with hypertension.},

We sought to characterize use of antihypertensives by and within medication class(es) between 1997 and 2017. Patients and Methods: A repeated cross-sectional study of 493,596 adult individuals using the 1997–2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The Orange Book was used for adjunctive information. The primary outcome was the estimated use by and within antihypertensive medication class(es). Results: The proportion of individuals taking any antihypertensive during a year increased from 1997 to the early 2010s and then remained stable. The proportion of adults using angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) increased during the study period, while angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) increased until 2010 after which rates remained stable. Beta-blocker use was similar to that of ACE-Is with an earlier decline starting in 2012. Thiazide diuretic use increased from 1997 to 2007, leveled off until 2014, and declined from 2015 to 2017. Non-dihydropyridine CCB use declined throughout the study. ACE-Is, ARBs, CCBs, thiazide diuretics, and loop diuretics all had one dominant in-class medication. There was a clear increase in the use of losartan within ARBs, lisinopril within ACE-Is, and amlodipine within CCBs following generic conversion. Furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide started with and maintained a dominant position in their classes. Metoprolol use increased throughout the study and became the dominant beta-blocker. Conclusions: Antihypertensive classes appear to have a propensity to equilibrate to an individual medication, despite a lack of outcomes-based research to compare medications within a class.},

Setting 1088 medical institutions, including general hospitals, traditional Chinese medicine hospitals, special hospitals, basic medical institutions and public health institutions. Participants 180 441 hypertensive outpatients and 14 763 inpatients from 1 January to 31 December 2017. Primary and secondary outcome measures Curative care expenditure for hypertension (CCEht) was measured based on System of Health Accounts 2011. Influenced factors were analysed by univariate analysis and multiple layer perceptron neural network. Results In 2017, CCEht was US$307.71 million, accounting for 3.63% of total CCE and 0.14% of gross domestic product (GDP) in Shanxi Province of China. CCE of hypertensive outpatients (CCEht-out) and inpatients (CCEht-in) accounted for 44.49% and 55.51% of CCEht. Drug fee accounted for 81.55% of CCEht-out and 22.50% of CCEht-in, respectively. The top three influencing factors were drug fee, surgical fee and hospitalisation days for inpatients, and drug fee, examination fee and test fee for outpatients. Conclusions The medical expenditure of hypertension is still heavy for individuals and society. The diagnosis and treatment capacities of primary healthcare system has been enhanced. New rural cooperation medical insurance and urban employee basic medical insurance have a trend of overusing, and the burden of family healthcare expenditure is still heavy. To ease the economic burden of patients with hypertension and improve the efficiency of social resources utilisation, policymakers should pay more attention to key groups, further increase support for primary healthcare system, standardise the treatment and reimbursement of hypertension and incline the reimbursement policy to outpatient service.},

   abstract = {Objectives: There is inadequate information on the economic burden of hypertension treatment in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the societal economic burden of hypertension at selected hospitals in Southern Ethiopia. Methods Prevalence-based cost of illness study from a societal perspective was conducted. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were determined by the current WHO's recommended DALY valuation method. Adjustment for comorbidity and a 3% discount was done for DALYs. The data entry, processing and analysis were done by using SPSS V.21.0 and Microsoft Excel V.2013. Results: We followed a cohort of 406 adult patients with hypertension retrospectively for 10 years from September 2010 to 2020. Two hundred and fifty (61.6%) of patients were women with a mean age of 55.87±11.03 years. Less than 1 in five 75 (18.5%) of patients achieved their blood pressure control target. A total of US$64 837.48 direct cost was incurred due to hypertension. A total of 11 585 years and 579.57 years were lost due to hypertension-related premature mortality and morbidity, respectively. Treated and uncontrolled hypertension accounted for 50.83% (6027) of total years lost due to premature mortality from treated hypertension cohort. Total productivity loss due to premature mortality and morbidity was US$449 394.69. The overall economic burden of hypertension was US$514 232.16 (US$105.55 per person per month). Conclusion: Societal economic burden of hypertension in Southern Ethiopia was substantial. Indirect costs accounted for more than 8 out of 10 dollars. Treated and uncontrolled hypertension took the lion's share of economic cost and productivity loss due to premature mortality and morbidity. Therefore, designing and implanting strategies for the prevention of hypertension, early screening and detection, and improving the rate of blood pressure control by involving all relevant stakeholders at all levels is critical to saving scarce health resources.},

   abstract = {Background: There is a robust understanding of how specific behavioural, metabolic, and environmental risk factors increase the risk of health burden. However, there is less understanding of how these risks individually and jointly affect health-care spending. The objective of this study was to quantify health-care spending attributable to modifiable risk factors in the USA for 2016. Methods: We extracted estimates of US health-care spending by condition, age, and sex from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Disease Expenditure Study 2016 and merged these estimates with population attributable fraction estimates for 84 modifiable risk factors from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 to produce estimates of spending by condition attributable to these risk factors. Because not all spending can be linked to health burden, we adjusted attributable spending estimates downwards, proportional to the association between health burden and health-care spending across time and age for each aggregate health condition. We propagated underlying uncertainty from the original data sources by randomly pairing the draws from the two studies and completing our analysis 1000 times independently. Findings: In 2016, US health-care spending attributable to modifiable risk factors was US$730·4 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 694·6–768·5), corresponding to 27·0% (95% UI 25·7–28·4) of total health-care spending. Attributable spending was largely due to five risk factors: high body-mass index ($238·5 billion, 178·2–291·6), high systolic blood pressure ($179·9 billion, 164·5–196·0), high fasting plasma glucose ($171·9 billion, 154·8–191·9), dietary risks ($143·6 billion, 130·3–156·1), and tobacco smoke ($130·0 billion, 116·8–143·5). Spending attributable to risk factor varied by age and sex, with the fraction of attributable spending largest for those aged 65 years and older (45·5%, 44·2–46·8). Interpretation: This study shows high spending on health care attributable to modifiable risk factors and highlights the need for preventing and controlling risk exposure. These attributable spending estimates can contribute to informed development and implementation of programmes to reduce risk exposure, their health burden, and health-care cost.

   abstract = {Purpose: Non-communicable diseases impose a significant social, economic and health burden. Hypertension, the leading contributor to the global burden of disease and a growing public health problem worldwide, is one of the most serious non-communicable diseases. In Ethiopia, empirical evidence on the economic burden of hypertension is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the cost of hypertension and associated factors at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital, northwest Ethiopia. Patients and Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 442 adult hypertensive patients using a semi-structured questionnaire to estimate the direct and indirect costs of hypertension. The human capital approach was used to calculate indirect costs. A generalized linear model was fitted to identify factors associated with the cost of hypertension at a 95% confidence level and <0.05 p-value. Results: A total of 442, 56.3% female and 64.3% stage one hypertension patients were included. The total cost of hypertension was ETB 2510.32 ($91.72) ± 2152.80 (78.65) per patient per year; The direct medical and non-medical cost constituted 60.81% and 12.17% of the total cost of hypertension, respectively. Hospitalized (exp(b)=1.87, p<0.001), using multidrug (exp(b)=1.32, p<0.000), high socioeconomic status (exp(b)=1.41,p<0.000), college and above education(exp(b)= 1.35, p<0.016), government employment (exp(b)= 1.30, p<0.012), retirement (exp(b)= 0.71, p< 0.001) and co-morbidity (exp(b)= 1.20, p<0.004) were factors significantly associated with the cost of hypertension. Conclusion: The total cost of illness of hypertension is high, and direct medical cost has the highest component of the total cost of illness. Hospitalization, using multidrug, co-morbidity, attending college and above education, highest socioeconomic status and government employment were factors significantly associated with the high cost of hypertension. Therefore, prevention and early detection of complications and co-morbidity are essential to reduce hospitalization and the number of drugs to reduce the direct medical and indirect costs.},

Finally, they provide an example of one academic health system that embarked on a journey to implement this framework and the initial results and lessons learned. In the current study, the authors found that: (1) the U.S. health system spends in excess of $1.3 trillion per year on suboptimal behavior; and (2) their organization was able to reduce the annual per-member-per-year cost by 9% over the course of 12 months by reducing specific defects in care.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertension is highly prevalent in the United States, affecting nearly half of all adults (43%). Studies have shown that pharmacist-physician collaborative care models (PPCCMs) for hypertension management significantly improve blood pressure (BP) control rates and provide consistent control of BP. Time in target range (TTR) for systolic BP is a novel measure of BP control consistency that is independently associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. There is no evidence that observed improvement in TTR for systolic BP with a PPCCM is cost-effective. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of a PPCCM with usual care for the management of hypertension from the payer perspective. METHODS: We used a decision analytic model with a 3-year time horizon based on published literature and publicly available data. The population consisted of adult patients who had a previous diagnosis of high BP (defined as office-based BP≥140/90 mmHg) or were receiving antihypertensive medications. Effectiveness data were drawn from 2 published studies evaluating the effect of PPCCMs (vs usual care) on TTR for systolic BP and the impact of TTR for systolic BP on 4 cardiovascular outcomes (nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, heart failure [HF], and cardiovascular disease [CVD] death). The model incorporated direct medical costs, including both programmatic costs (ie, direct costs for provider time) and downstream health care utilization associated with acute cardiovascular events. One-way sensitivity and threshold analyses examined model robustness. RESULTS: In base-case analyses, PPCCM hypertension management was associated with lower downstream medical expenditures (difference: −$162.86) and lower total program costs (difference: −$108.00) when compared with usual care. PPCCM was associated with lower downstream medical expenditures across all parameter ranges tested in the deterministic sensitivity analysis. For every 10,000 hypertension patients managed with PPCCM vs usual care over a 3-year time horizon, approximately 27 CVD deaths, 29 strokes, 21 nonfatal MIs, and 12 incident HF diagnoses are expected to be averted. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PPCCM compared to usual care on TTR for systolic BP in adults with hypertension. PPCCM was less costly to administer and resulted in downstream health care savings and fewer acute cardiovascular events relative to usual care. Although further research is needed to evaluate the long-term costs and outcomes of PPCCM, payer coverage of PPCCM services may prevent future health care costs and improve patient cardiovascular outcomes.},

Long-standing disparities in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control among racial and ethnic populations exist in the United States. High-quality evidence exists for how to prevent and control hypertension and for the role nurses can play in this effort. In response to the 2020 Surgeon General's Call to Action to Control Hypertension, nursing leaders from 11 national organizations identified the critical roles and actions of nursing in improving hypertension control and cardiovascular health, focusing on evidence-based nursing interventions and available resources. Aims: To develop a unified “Call to Action for Nurses” to improve control of hypertension and cardiovascular health and provide information and resources to execute this call. Methods: This paper outlines roles that registered nurses, advanced practice nurses, schools of nursing, professional nursing organizations, quality improvement nurses, and nursing researchers can play to control hypertension and prevent CVD in the United States. It describes evidence-based interventions to improve cardiovascular health and outlines actions to bring hypertension and CVD to the forefront as a national priority for nursing. Linking Evidence to Action: Evidence-based interventions exist for nurses to lead efforts to prevent and control hypertension, thus preventing much CVD. Nurses can take actions in their communities, their healthcare setting, and their organization to translate these interventions into real-world practice settings.},

In Brazil, the prevalence of SAH is 23.7%, which caused 203,000 deaths and 3.9 million DALYs in 2015. Objective To estimate the cost of SAH and circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH from the perspective of the Brazilian public health system in 2019. Methods A prevalence-based cost-of-illness was conducted using a top-down approach. The population attributable risk (PAR) was used to estimate the proportion of circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH. The direct medical costs were obtained from official Ministry of Health of Brazil records and literature parameters, including the three levels of care (primary, secondary, and tertiary). Deterministic univariate analyses were also conducted. Results The total cost of SAH and the proportion of circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH was Int$ 581,135,374.73, varying between Int$ 501,553,022.21 and Int$ 776,183,338.06. In terms only of SAH costs at all healthcare levels (Int$ 493,776,445.89), 97.3% were incurred in primary care, especially for antihypertensive drugs provided free of charge by the Brazilian public health system (Int$ 363,888,540.14). Stroke accounted for the highest cost attributable to SAH and the third highest PAR, representing 47% of the total cost of circulatory diseases attributable to SAH. Prevalence was the parameter that most affected sensitivity analyses, accounting for 36% of all the cost variation. Conclusion Our results show that the main Brazilian strategy to combat SAH was implemented in primary care, namely access to free antihypertensive drugs and multiprofessional teams, acting jointly to promote care and prevent and control SAH.},

In this study, we aimed to quantify the overall and marginal impact of favorable cardiovascular risk factor (CRF) profile on healthcare expenditure and resource utilization in the United States among those with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods and Results-The study population was derived from the 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Direct and indirect costs were calculated for all-cause healthcare resource utilization. Variables of interest included CVD diagnoses (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, dysrhythmias, or heart failure), ascertained by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification codes, and CRF profile (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, physical activity, and obesity). Two-part econometric models were used to study expenditure data. The final study sample consisted of 15 651 MEPS participants (58.5±12 years, 54% female). Overall, 5921 (37.8%) had optimal, 7002 (44.7%) had average, and 2728 (17.4%) had poor CRF profile, translating to 54.2, 64.1, and 24.9 million adults in United States, respectively. Significantly lower health expenditures were noted with favorable CRF profile across CVD status. Among study participants with established CVD, overall healthcare expenditures with optimal and average CRF profile were $5946 and $3731 less compared with those with poor CRF profile. The respective differences were $4031 and $2560 in those without CVD. Conclusions-Favorable CRF profile is associated with significantly lower medical expenditure and healthcare utilization among individuals with and without established CVD.},

A number of treatment options are available to control blood pressure. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of health services and self-care amongst people with hypertension and to estimate the out-of-pocket expenses associated with such health care use. A sub-study of the 45 and Up Study was conducted amongst 1300 individuals who had earlier reported a clinical diagnosis of hypertension in 2017. A total of 753 (57.9%) individuals with hypertension returned a completed questionnaire.

The average total out-of-pocket expenditure for hypertension-related health care was Australian $461.8 per annum, with an estimated Australian $941 million per annum if extrapolated to all Australians aged 55 years and over with hypertension. Older people with hypertension use a wide range of health services to control their blood pressure including conventional medicine, allied health and complementary medicine practitioners as well as various self-care practices. A substantial amount of out-of-pocket expenditure has been spent on hypertension care annually. Given the global health and economic burden of hypertension, there is an urgent need for more research exploring cost-effective management(s) for hypertensive patients.},

   abstract = {Background: Hypertension requires life-long medical care, which may cause economic burden and even lead to catastrophic health expenditure. Objective: To estimate the extent of out-of-pocket expenditure for hypertension care at a population level and its impact on households’ budgets in a low-income urban setting in Colombia. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Santa Cruz, a commune in the city of Medellin. In 410 randomly selected households with a hypertensive adult, we estimated annual basic household expenditure and hypertension-attributable out-of-pocket expenditure. For socioeconomic stratification, we categorised households according to basic expenditure quintiles. Catastrophic hypertension-attributable expenditure was defined as out-of-pocket expenditure above 10% of total household expenditure. Results: The average annual basic household expenditure was US dollars at purchasing power parity (USD-PPP) $12,255.59. The average annual hypertension-attributable out-of-pocket expenditure was USD-PPP $147.75 (95% CI 120.93–174.52). It was incurred by 73.9% (95% CI 69.4%-78.1%) of patients, and consisted mainly of direct non-medical expenses (76.7%), predominantly for dietary requirements prescribed as non-pharmacological treatment and for transport to attend health care consultations. Medical out-of-pocket expenditure (23.3%) was for the most part incurred for pharmacological treatment. Hypertension-attributable out-of-pocket expenditure represented on average 1.6% (95% CI 1.3%-1.9%) of the total annual basic household expenditure. Eight households (2.0%; 95% CI 1.0%-3.8%) had catastrophic health expenditure; six of them belonged to the two lowest expenditure quintiles. Payments related to dietary requirements and transport to consultations were critical determinants of their catastrophic expenditure. Conclusions: Out-of-pocket expenditure for hypertension care is moderate on average, but frequent, and mainly made up of direct non-medical expenses. Catastrophic health expenditure is uncommon and affects primarily households in the bottom socioeconomic quintiles. Financial protection should be strengthened by covering the costs of chronic diseases-related dietary requirements and transport to health services in the most deprived households.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: High blood pressure is a leading risk factor for
death and disability in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We evaluated
the costs and cost-effectiveness of hypertension care provided
within the Kwara State Health Insurance (KSHI) program in rural
Nigeria. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the
costs and cost-effectiveness of population-level hypertension
screening and subsequent antihypertensive treatment for the
population at-risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) within the
KSHI program. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted in the KSHI
scenario compared to no access to hypertension care. We used
setting-specific and empirically-collected data to inform the
model. We defined two strategies to assess eligibility for
antihypertensive treatment based on 1) presence of hypertension
grade 1 and 10-year CVD risk of >20%, or grade 2 hypertension
irrespective of 10-year CVD risk (hypertension and risk based
strategy) and 2) presence of hypertension in combination with a
CVD risk of >20% (risk based strategy). We generated 95%
confidence intervals around the primary outcome through
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We conducted one-way
sensitivity analyses across key model parameters and assessed
the sensitivity of our results to the performance of the
reference scenario. RESULTS: Screening and treatment for
hypertension was potentially cost-effective but the results were
sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions with a wide range
of uncertainty. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the
first and second strategy respectively ranged from US 1,406 to
US 7,815 and US 732 to US 2,959 per DALY averted, depending
on the assumptions on risk reduction after treatment and
compared to no access to antihypertensive treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension care within a subsidized private
health insurance program may be cost-effective in rural Nigeria
and public-private partnerships such as the KSHI program may
provide opportunities to finance CVD prevention care in SSA.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the processes, outcomes and costs of
implementing a multi-component, community-based intervention for
hypertension among adults aged > 35 years in a large slum in
Nairobi, Kenya. METHODS: The intervention in 2012-2013 was based
on four components: awareness-raising; improved access to
screening; standardized clinical management of hypertension; and
long-term retention in care. Using multiple sources of data,
including administrative records and surveys, we described the
inputs and outputs of each intervention activity and estimated
the outcomes of each component and the impact of the
intervention. We also estimated the costs associated with
implementation, using a top-down costing approach. FINDINGS: The
intervention reached 60% of the target population (4049/6780
people), at a cost of 17 United States dollars (US) per person
screened and provided access to treatment for 68% (660/976) of
people referred, at a cost of US 123 per person with
hypertension who attended the clinic. Of the 660 people who
attended the clinic, 27% (178) were retained in care, at a cost
of US 194 per person retained; and of those patients, 33%
(58/178) achieved blood pressure control. The total intervention
cost per patient with blood pressure controlled was US 3205.
CONCLUSION: With moderate implementation costs, it was possible
to achieve hypertension awareness and treatment levels comparable
to those in high-income settings. However, retention in care and
blood pressure control were challenges in this slum setting. For
patients, the costs and lack of time or forgetfulness were
barriers to retention in care.},

Portugal is between 29.1% and 42.2%. International studies show
that 13% of individuals have masked hypertension and 13% of
diagnoses based on office blood pressure measurements are in fact
white coat hypertension. More sensitive and specific blood
pressure measuring methods could avoid costs associated with
misdiagnosis. The aim of this study was to review the
cost-effectiveness of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)
compared to other methods in the management of hypertension.
METHODS: We performed a literature search in CMA Infobase,
Guidelines Finder, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Bandolier,
BMJ Clinical Evidence, the Cochrane Library, DARE, Medline, the
Trip Database, SUMSearch and Índex das Revistas Médicas
Portuguesas. We researched articles published between January
2005 and August 2015 in Portuguese, English and Spanish, using
the MeSH terms ``Hypertension'', ``Blood Pressure Monitoring,
Ambulatory'' and ``Cost-Benefit Analysis'' and the Portuguese
search terms ``Hipertensão'', ``Monitorização

recommendation were attributed according to the Oxford Centre for
Evidence-Based Medicine scale. RESULTS: Five hundred and
twenty-five articles were identified. We included five original
studies and one clinical practice guideline. All of them state
that ABPM is the most cost-effective method. Two report better
blood pressure control, and a Portuguese study revealed a saving
of 23%. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence shows that ABPM is
cost-effective, avoiding iatrogenic effects and reducing
expenditure on treatment (grade of recommendation B). The
included studies provide a solid basis, but further evidence of
reproducibility is needed in research that is not based mainly on

EMBASE, MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane and others until July 2016.
Study selection was limited to CEA and CUA conducted in member
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) in English, German or French, without time
limit. Outcomes measures were life years gained (LYG),
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and quality-adjusted life
years (QALY). Relevant aspects in modelling were analysed and
compared. Quality assessments were conducted using the Drummond
and Jefferson/British Medical Journal checklist. SETTING: OECD
member countries. SUBJECTS: Mainly adults. RESULTS: Fourteen CEA
and CUA were included in the review which analysed different
strategies: salt reduction or substitution in processed foods,
taxes, labelling, awareness campaigns and targeted dietary
advice. Fifty-nine out of sixty-two scenarios were cost-saving.
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in international dollars
(Intl.; 2015) was particularly low for taxes, a salt reduction
by food manufacturers and labelling (303 900 Intl./DALY).
However, only six studies analysed cost-effectiveness from a
societal perspective and quality assessments showed flaws in
conducting and a lack of transparency in reporting. CONCLUSIONS:
A population-wide salt reduction could be cost-effective in
prevention of hypertension and CVD in OECD member countries.

important factor of unsatisfactory blood pressure (BP) control.
This review focuses on therapy-related factors affecting
adherence and suggests how to improve it with a wise choice of
treatment schedule. Complex drug treatment schemes, poor
tolerability and drug substitutions are frequent causes of poor
adherence which, in turn, causes insufficient BP control, greater
incidence of cardiovascular events and, finally, higher global
health costs. The effects of prescribing generic drugs and of
drug substitutions on adherence is also discussed. In terms of
adherence, generic drugs do not seem to be better than branded
drugs, unless patients have to bear very high ``out of pocket''
expenses to buy original drugs, suggesting no advantages in
switching drug with the mere goal of reducing the cost of
therapy. An important role in improving adherence (and thus
cardiovascular events and health expenditure) is also played by
the availability of fixed-dose combinations; among
antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are
those associated with higher levels of adherence and persistence.

hypertension have been documented in the U.S., but changes in
medical expenditures associated with hypertension over time have
not been evaluated. This study analyzed these expenditures during
2000-2013 among U.S. adults. METHODS: Data from the Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey were analyzed in 2016. The study
population was non-institutionalized men and non-pregnant women
aged 18 years. Hypertension was defined as ever been
diagnosed with hypertension or currently taking antihypertensive
medications. Medical expenditures included all payments to
medical care providers. Expenditures associated with hypertension
were estimated by two-part regression models and adjusted into
2015 U.S. dollars. Controlling variables included
sociodemographic characteristics, marital status, insurance,
region, smoking status, weight status, health status, and
comorbidities. Trends were analyzed using joinpoint method.
RESULTS: Total per-person annual expenditures associated with
hypertension in 2000-2001 (1,399) were not significantly
different from those in 2012-2013 (1,494) (average annual
percent change [AAPC]= -0.6%, p=0.794), but annual national
spending increased significantly from 58.7 billion to 109.1
billion (AAPC=8.3%, p=0.015), mainly because of the increase in
the number of people treated for hypertension. Per-person
outpatient payments were 22.7% higher in 2012-2013 than in
2000-2001 (416 vs 322, p<0.05; AAPC=0.8%, p-trend=0.826).
Payments for prescription medications took up a larger proportion
of the medical expenditures associated with hypertension,
compared to payments for outpatient or other services
(33%-46%). CONCLUSIONS: During 2000-2013, annual national
medical expenditures associated with hypertension increased
significantly. Preventing hypertension could alleviate

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug expenditures are responsible for an increasing
proportion of health costs, accounting for $1.1 trillion in
annual expenditure worldwide. As hundreds of billions of dollars
are being spent each year on overtreatment with prescribed
medications that are either unnecessary or are in excess of
lowest cost-effective therapy, programs are needed that optimize
fiscally appropriate use. We evaluated whether providing
physicians with information on the patient out-of-pocket payment
consequences of prescribing decisions that were in excess of
lowest cost-effective therapy would alter prescribing decisions
using the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension as an exemplar.
METHODS: A single-blind cluster randomized trial was conducted
over a 60-month follow-up period in 76 primary care physicians in
Quebec, Canada, and their patients with uncomplicated
hypertension who were using the MOXXI integrated electronic
health record for drug and health problem management. Physicians
were randomized to an out-of-pocket expenditure module that
provided alerts for comparative out-of-payment costs, thiazide
diuretics as recommended first-line therapy, and tools to monitor
blood pressure targets and medication compliance, or
alternatively the basic MOXXI system. System software and
prescription claims were used to analyze the impact of the
intervention on treatment choice, adherence, and overall and
out-of-pocket payment costs using generalized estimating
equations. RESULTS: Three thousand five-hundred ninety-two
eligible patients with uncomplicated hypertension were enrolled,
of whom 1261 (35.1%) were newly started (incident patient) on
treatment during follow-up. There was a statistically significant
increase in the prescription of diuretics in the newly treated
intervention (26.6%) compared to control patients (19.8%) (RR
1.65, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.33). For patients already treated
(prevalent patient), there was a statistically significant
interaction between the intervention and patient age, with older
patients being less likely to be switched to a diuretic. Among
the incident patients, physicians with less than 15 years of
experience were much more likely to prescribe a diuretic (OR
10.69; 95% CI 1.49 to 76.64) than physicians with 15 to 25 years
(OR 0.67; 95%CI 0.25 to 1.78), or more than 25 years of
experience (OR 1.80; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.65). There was no
statistically significant effect of the intervention on adherence
or out-of-pocket payment cost. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of
comparative information on patient out-of-pocket payments for
treatment of uncomplicated hypertension had a statistically
significant impact on increasing the initiation of diuretics in
incident patients and switching to diuretics in younger prevalent
patients. The impact of interventions to improve the
cost-effectiveness of prescribing may be enhanced by also
targeting patients with tools to participate in treatment
decision-making and by providing physicians with comparative
out-of-pocket information on all evidence-based alternatives that
would enhance clinical decision-making. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

pressure management and its impact on the stage of the disease in
a group of patients from Tunja, Boyacá, Colombia. MATERIALS
AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness, cross-sectional study. 172
clinical histories of patients with high blood pressure from
Tunja, Colombia, were included. RESULTS: The average cost of care
in the primary care service was $184 631 pesos per
month/patient; 61% of this amount is spent on human resources,
20% on laboratory tests and 10% on medication. Compliance with
the program was 72.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The expenditure on human
talent is more than 50% of the resources allocated for the
management of high blood pressure, but this has positive
repercussions on the control and management of this condition.
High blood pressure figures show controlled management of the
patients included in the program: 61% of them had normal figures
and 53% were classified in the normal stages. High blood
pressure requires a large amount of resources, so it should be
studied by multidisciplinary health teams in order to find more
efficient management alternatives.},

therapies were associated with higher adherence than PDE-5Is and
monotherapies, respectively. Healthcare utilization was
substantial across the study population, with costs in the
combination therapy cohort more than doubling from baseline to
follow-up. The majority of patients were treated with
monotherapies (most often, PDE-5Is), despite combination

including Kenya, is of economic importance due to its increasing
prevalence and its potential to present an economic burden to
households. In this study, we examined the patient costs
associated with obtaining care for hypertension in public health
care facilities in Kenya. METHODS: We conducted a
cross-sectional study among adult respondents above 18 years of
age, with at least 6 months of treatment in two counties. A
total of 212 patients seeking hypertension care at five public
facilities were interviewed, and information on care seeking and
the associated costs was obtained. We computed both annual
direct and indirect costs borne by these patients. RESULTS:
Overall, the mean annual direct cost to patients was US$ 304.8
(95% CI, 235.7-374.0). Medicines (mean annual cost, US$ 168.9;
95% CI, 132.5-205.4), transport (mean annual cost, US$ 126.7;
95% CI, 77.6-175.9), and user charges (mean annual cost, US$
57.7; 95% CI, 43.7-71.6) were the highest direct cost
categories. Overall mean annual indirect cost was US$ 171.7
(95% CI, 152.8-190.5). The incidence of catastrophic health
care costs was 43.3% (95% CI, 36.8-50.2) and increased to
59.0% (95% CI, 52.2-65.4) when transport costs were included.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive patients incur substantial direct and
indirect costs. High rates of catastrophic costs illustrate the
urgency of improving financial risk protection for these
patients and strengthening primary care to ensure affordability
of hypertension care.},

differential cost sharing to increase the utilization of primary
care clinics for the management of chronic diseases. The
objective of this study was to examine the impact of the
prescription drug cost-sharing increase on outpatients'
selection of the medical care institution. STUDY DESIGN: This
was a pre-post comparison study. METHODS: Participants were
34,842 patients with hypertension and 13,886 patients with type
2 diabetes, who were all newly prescribed. Data were collected
via national health insurance system claims. The change in the
main medical care institution for disease management before and
after the cost sharing policy was analyzed using logistic
regression analysis. RESULTS: Nearly 18% of participants with
hypertension and 22% of participants with diabetes used
tertiary care or general hospital outpatient services before the
policy was implemented. After the increased prescription drug
coinsurance rate (by 10-20%), the likelihood of selecting
primary care clinics or small hospitals was significantly higher
among patients with hypertension within 1 year (odds ratio [95%
confidence interval] = 1.29 [1.19-1.41]) than before. However,
the policy effect was not significant among patients with

inducing patients with hypertension to manage their chronic

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Turkey, hypertension was responsible for 13% of
total deaths in 2015. We apply existing research finding
regarding the impact of a population-wide reduction in sodium
consumption on the decrease of the hypertension prevalence rate
among 15+ years population and the gender-age specific reduction
in total death rates among 30+ years population, and compare
hypertension burden, averted deaths, costs and benefits between
two scenarios. METHODS: The first scenario (i.e. status quo)
assumes constant hypertension prevalence rate and the death
rates between 2015 and 2030. Based on the Framingham Heart Study
and INTERSALT Study findings on the impact of salt-reduction
strategies on hypertension prevalence rate, the second scenario
(Scenario II) assumes a 17% reduction in the prevalence of
hypertension in Turkey in 2030, from its 2015 prevalence level.
We project hypertension attributable disability adjusted life
years (DALYs) in 2030, monetize DALYs using GDP (and income) per
capita, and compare the projected economic benefits of DALYs
averted and the additional costs associated with the increases
in hypertension treatment through antihypertensive medications
and physician consultations. RESULTS: The estimated benefits of
reducing the economic burden of hypertension deaths outweigh the
cost of providing hypertension treatment. A decrease in
hypertension prevalence by 17%, attributable to population-wide
reduction in salt consumption, is projected to avert 24.3
thousand deaths in 2030. We projected that, compared to status
quo, 392 thousand DALYs will be averted in Scenario II in 2030.
The economic benefits of reduction in potential hypertension
deaths are estimated to be 6.7 to 8.6 folds higher than the
additional cost of hypertension treatment. CONCLUSION:
Population-wide hypertension prevention and management is a
win-win situation for public health and the Turkish health care
system as the economic benefits of reducing deaths and
disabilities associated with hypertension outweigh the costs
significantly.},

affordability is a key goal of Brazilian health policies.
``Farmácia Popular'' (FP) Program is one of the government's
key strategies to achieve this goal. Under FP, antihypertension
(HTN) and antiglycemic (DM) medicines have been provided at
subsidized prices in private retail settings since 2006, and
free of charge since 2011. We aim to assess the impact of
sequential changes in FP benefits on patient affordability and
government expenditures for HTN and DM treatment under the FP,
and examine their implications for public financing mechanisms
and program sustainability. Methods Longitudinal, retrospective
study using interrupted time series to analyze: HTN and DM
treatment coverage; total and per capita expenditure; percentage
paid by MoH; and patient cost sharing. Analyzes were conducted
in the dispensing database of the FP program (from 2006 to
2012). Results FP has increased its coverage over time; by
December 2012 FP covered on average 13% of DM and 11.5% of HTN
utilization, a growth of over 600 and 1500%, respectively. The
overall cost per treatment to the MoH declined from R36.43 (R
= reais, the Brazilian currency) to 18.74 for HTN and from
R33.07to R15.05 for DM over the period analyzed, representing
a reduction in per capita cost greater than 50%. The amount
paid by patients for the medicines covered increased over time
until 2011, but then declined to zero. We estimate that to treat
all patients in need for HTN and DM in 2012 under FP, the
Government would need to expend 97% of the total medicines
budget. Conclusions FP rapidly increased its coverage in terms
of both program reach and proportion of cost subsidized during
the period analyzed. Costs of individual HTN and DM treatments
in FP were reduced after 2011 for both patients (free) and
government (better negotiated prices). However, overall FP
expenditures by MoH increased due to markedly increased
utilization. The FP is sustainable as a complementary policy but
cannot feasibly substitute for the distribution of medicines by
the SUS.},

serious complications and contributes to high costs incurred by
the whole society. The aim of the review was to carry out a
social and economic comparison of various categories of
hypertension costs from different countries. MATERIAL AND
METHODS: The study was a systematic review. PubMed, Cochrane
Library and Google Scholar databases were searched. Hypertension
costs were analyzed in 8 cost categories. An attempt was made to
determine whether selected economic and social factors (such as
HDI or GDP) influenced hypertension costs. RESULTS: The review
included data from 15 countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Canada,
China, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Jamaica, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico,
Poland, Spain, USA, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. The papers included in
the review were heterogeneous with respect to cost categories,
which made comparisons difficult. The average total costs of
hypertension for all the studied countries, calculated per
person, amounted to 630.14 Int, direct costs - 1,497.36 Int,
and indirect costs - 282.34 Int. The ranking of countries by
costs and by selected economic and social indices points at the
possible relationship between these indices and hypertension
costs. CONCLUSIONS: The costs of hypertension calculated per
country reached the region of several dozen billion Int. Other
sources usually showed lower costs than those presented in this
review. This indicates a growth in costs from year to year and
the future increasing burden on society. Globally uniform cost
terminology and cost calculation standards need to be developed.
That would facilitate making more informed decisions regarding
fund allocation in hypertension management schemes.},

economic and health burden. Hypertension, the leading
contributor to the global burden of disease and a growing public
health problem worldwide, is one of the most serious
non-communicable diseases. In Ethiopia, empirical evidence on
the economic burden of hypertension is limited. Therefore, this
study aimed to measure the cost of hypertension and associated
factors at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized
hospital, northwest Ethiopia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An
institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 442
adult hypertensive patients using a semi-structured
questionnaire to estimate the direct and indirect costs of
hypertension. The human capital approach was used to calculate
indirect costs. A generalized linear model was fitted to
identify factors associated with the cost of hypertension at a
95% confidence level and <0.05 p-value. RESULTS: A total of
442, 56.3% female and 64.3% stage one hypertension patients
were included. The total cost of hypertension was ETB 2510.32
($91.72)  2152.80 (78.65) per patient per year; The direct
medical and non-medical cost constituted 60.81% and 12.17% of
the total cost of hypertension, respectively. Hospitalized
(exp(b)=1.87, p<0.001), using multidrug (exp(b)=1.32, p<0.000),
high socioeconomic status (exp(b)=1.41,p<0.000), college and
above education(exp(b)= 1.35, p<0.016), government employment
(exp(b)= 1.30, p<0.012), retirement (exp(b)= 0.71, p< 0.001) and
co-morbidity (exp(b)= 1.20, p<0.004) were factors significantly
associated with the cost of hypertension. CONCLUSION: The total
cost of illness of hypertension is high, and direct medical cost
has the highest component of the total cost of illness.
Hospitalization, using multidrug, co-morbidity, attending
college and above education, highest socioeconomic status and
government employment were factors significantly associated with
the high cost of hypertension. Therefore, prevention and early
detection of complications and co-morbidity are essential to
reduce hospitalization and the number of drugs to reduce the
direct medical and indirect costs.},

cardiovascular diseases (CVD), such as coronary heart disease,
stroke, hypertensive disease, aortic aneurysm, heart failure,
pulmonary embolism, and rheumatic heart, using the relative
risks of disease and the prevalence of salt consumption in the
population. The methodology includes (a) identifying major
diseases and conditions related to excessive salt intake and
relevant economic cost data available, (b) quantifying the
relationship between the prevalence of excessive salt intake and
the associated risk of disease morbidity and mortality using
population attributable risks (PAR), (c) using PARs to estimate
the share of total costs directly attributed to excessive salt
intake, and (d) undertaking a sensitivity analysis of key
epidemiological and economic parameters. The costing tool has
estimated that, in 2013, US 102.0 million (95% uncertainty
interval-UI: US 96.2-107.8 million) in public hospitalizations
could be saved if the average salt intake of Brazilians were
reduced to 5 g/d, corresponding to 9.4% (95% UI: 8.9%-9.9%)
of the total hospital costs by CVDs. This methodology of cost of
illness associated with salt consumption can be adapted to
estimate the burden of other dietary risk factors and support
prevention and control policies in Brazil and in other
countries.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost attributable to arterial
hypertension, diabetes and obesity in the Unified Health System
of Brazil in 2018. METHOD: The study estimated the cost
attributable to non-communicable chronic diseases based on
relative risk and population prevalence of hypertension,
diabetes, and obesity, considering the cost of hospitalizations,
outpatient procedures, and medications distributed by the SUS to
treat these diseases. Cost data were obtained from SUS
information systems. The analysis explored the cost of disease
according to sex and age in the adult population. RESULTS: The
total cost of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity in the SUS
reached R$ 3.45 billion (95%CI: 3.15-3.75) in 2018, that is,
more than US$ 890 million. Of this amount, 59% referred to the
treatment of hypertension, 30% to diabetes, and 11% to obesity.
The age group from 30 to 69 years accounted for 72% of the total
costs, and women accounted for 56%. When obesity was considered
separately as a risk factor for hypertension and diabetes, the
cost attributable to this diseases reached R$ 1.42 billion
(95%CI: 0.98-1.87), i.e., 41% of the total cost. CONCLUSIONS:
The estimates of costs attributable to the main chronic diseases
associated with inadequate diet revealed a heavy economic burden
of these disorders for the SUS. The data show the need to
prioritize integrated and intersectoral policies for the
prevention and control of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity,
and may support the advocacy for interventions such as fiscal and
regulatory measures to ensure that the objectives of the United
Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition are met.},

main risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Since the
incidence of hypertension is rising in Ethiopia, one may expect
that the household's cost of healthcare services related to the
disease will increase in the near future. Yet the cost
associated with the disease is not known. We aimed to estimate
the total cost of hypertension illness and identify associated
factors among patients attending hospitals in Southwest Shewa
zone, Oromia regional state, Ethiopia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An
institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed to
conduct the study from 13 August to 2 September 2018. All
hypertensive patients aged 18 years and older who were on
follow-up were eligible for this study. The total cost of
hypertension illness was estimated by summing the direct and
indirect costs. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression
analyses were performed to identify factors associated with
hypertension costs of illnesses. RESULTS: A total of 349
patients participated in the study. The mean monthly total cost
of hypertension illness was US$ 22.3 (95% CI, 21.3-23.3).
Direct and indirect costs constitute 51% and 49% of the total
cost, respectively. The mean direct cost of hypertension illness
per patient per month was US$ 11.39 (95% CI, 10.6-12.1). Out
of these, drugs comprised higher cost (31%), followed by food
(25%). The mean indirect cost per patient per month was US$
10.89 (95% CI, 10.4-11.4). In this study, the primary
educational status, family size (4-6 and >6), distance from
hospital (10 km), the presence of a companion and stage of
hypertension (stage two) of patients were identified as the
predictors of the cost of hypertension illnesses. CONCLUSION:
The cost of hypertension illness was very high when compared to
the monthly income of households, exposing patients to
catastrophic costs. Hence, the government should give due
attention to protect patients from catastrophic health
expenditures.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), a global
public health problem and the primary risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases, has a significant financial impact on
health systems. In Brazil, the prevalence of SAH is 23.7%,
which caused 203,000 deaths and 3.9 million DALYs in 2015.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost of SAH and circulatory system
diseases attributable to SAH from the perspective of the
Brazilian public health system in 2019. METHODS: A
prevalence-based cost-of-illness was conducted using a top-down
approach. The population attributable risk (PAR) was used to
estimate the proportion of circulatory system diseases
attributable to SAH. The direct medical costs were obtained from
official Ministry of Health of Brazil records and literature
parameters, including the three levels of care (primary,
secondary, and tertiary). Deterministic univariate analyses were
also conducted. RESULTS: The total cost of SAH and the
proportion of circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH
was Int$ 581,135,374.73, varying between Int$ 501,553,022.21
and Int$ 776,183,338.06. In terms only of SAH costs at all
healthcare levels (Int$ 493,776,445.89), 97.3% were incurred
in primary care, especially for antihypertensive drugs provided
free of charge by the Brazilian public health system (Int$
363,888,540.14). Stroke accounted for the highest cost
attributable to SAH and the third highest PAR, representing 47%
of the total cost of circulatory diseases attributable to SAH.
Prevalence was the parameter that most affected sensitivity
analyses, accounting for 36% of all the cost variation.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the main Brazilian strategy to
combat SAH was implemented in primary care, namely access to
free antihypertensive drugs and multiprofessional teams, acting
jointly to promote care and prevent and control SAH.},

Study), pharmacist-led hypertension care in Los Angeles County
Black-owned barbershops significantly improved blood pressure
control in non-Hispanic Black men with uncontrolled hypertension
at baseline. In this analysis, 10-year health outcomes and
health care costs of 1 year of the LABBPS intervention versus
control are projected. METHODS: A discrete event simulation of
hypertension care processes projected blood pressure,
medication-related adverse events, fatal and nonfatal
cardiovascular disease events, and noncardiovascular disease
death in LABBPS participants. Program costs, total direct health
care costs (2019 US dollars), and quality-adjusted life-years
(QALYs) were estimated for the LABBPS intervention and control
arms from a health care sector perspective over a 10-year
horizon. Future costs and QALYs were discounted 3% annually.
High and intermediate cost-effectiveness thresholds were defined
as <$50 000 and <$150 000 per QALY gained, respectively.
RESULTS: At 10 years, the intervention was projected to cost an
average of $2356 (95% uncertainty interval, -$264 to $4611)
more per participant than the control arm and gain 0.06 (95%
uncertainty interval, 0.01-0.10) QALYs. The LABBPS intervention
was highly cost-effective, with a mean cost of $42 717 per QALY
gained (58% probability of being highly and 96% of being at
least intermediately cost-effective). Exclusive use of generic
drugs improved the cost-effectiveness to $17 162 per QALY
gained. The LABBPS intervention would be only intermediately
cost-effective if pharmacists were less likely to intensify
antihypertensive medications when systolic blood pressure was
150 mm Hg or if pharmacist weekly time driving to
barbershops increased. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension care delivered
by clinical pharmacists in Black barbershops is a highly
cost-effective way to improve blood pressure control in Black
men.},

middle-income countries, and it is an important preventable risk
factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Understanding the
economic benefits of a hypertension control program is valuable
to decision-makers. Objective: To evaluate the long-term
cost-effectiveness of a multicomponent hypertension management
program compared with usual care among patients with
hypertension receiving care in public clinics in Argentina from
a health care system perspective. Design, Setting, and
Participants: This economic evaluation used a Markov model to
estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypertension management
program among adult patients with uncontrolled hypertension in a
low-income setting. Patient-level data (743 individuals for
multicomponent intervention; 689 for usual care) from the
Hypertension Control Program in Argentina trial (HCPIA) were
used to estimate treatment effects and the risk of CVD. Three
health states were included in each strategy: (1) low risk of
CVD, (2) high risk of CVD, and (3) death. The total time horizon
was the lifetime, and each cycle lasted 6 months. Main Outcomes
and Measures: Model inputs were based on trial data and other
published sources. Cost and utilities were discounted at a rate
of 5% annually. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)
between the multicomponent intervention and usual care was
calculated using the difference in costs in 2017 international
dollars (INT ) divided by the difference in effectiveness in
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). One-way sensitivity
analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed
to assess the uncertainty and robustness of the results.
Results: In the original trial, the 743 participants in the
intervention group (349 [47.0%] men) had a mean (SD) age of
56.2 (12.0) years, and the 689 participants in the control group
(311 [45.1%] men) had a mean (SD) age of 56.2 (11.7) years. In
the base-case analysis, the HCPIA program yielded 8.42
discounted QALYs and accrued INT 3096 discounted costs, while
usual care yielded 8.29 discounted QALYs and accrued INT 2473
discounted costs. The ICER for the HCPIA program was INT
4907/QALY gained. The model results remained robust in
sensitivity analyses, and the model was most sensitive to
parameters of program costs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this
study, the HCPIA multicomponent intervention vs usual care was a
cost-effective strategy to improve hypertension management and
reduce the risk of associated CVD among patients with
hypertension who received services at public clinics in
Argentina. This intervention program is likely transferable to
other settings in Argentina or other lower- and middle-income
countries.},

ComHIP, an intervention with multiple components, including:
community-based education on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
factors and healthy lifestyles; community-based screening and
monitoring of blood pressure by licensed chemical sellers and
CVD nurses; community-based diagnosis, treatment, counselling,
follow-up and referral of hypertension patients by CVD nurses;

information and communication technologies messages for healthy
lifestyles, treatment adherence support and treatment refill

(SMS)/voice messaging for treatment adherence, reminders and
health messaging. ComHIP was evaluated under two scale-up
scenarios: (1) ComHIP as currently implemented with support from
international partners and (2) ComHIP under full local

disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted from a societal
perspective over a time horizon of 10 years. RESULTS: ComHIP is
unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention, with current
ComHIP implementation and ComHIP under full local implementation
costing on average US12 189 and US6530 per DALY averted,
respectively. Results were robust to uncertainty analyses around
model parameters. CONCLUSIONS: High overhead costs and high
patient costs in ComHIP suggest that the societal costs of
ensuring appropriate hypertension care are high and may not
produce sufficient impact to achieve cost-effective
implementation. However, these results are limited by the
evidence quality of the effectiveness estimates, which comes
from observational data rather than from randomised controlled

indicators related to the challenges of delivering UHC for

other. Population and patient factors include (1) unhealthy
lifestyles overburdening the health system, (2) poor
health-seeking behaviour and (3) poor adherence to medication,
which has led to uncontrolled cases and poor clinical outcomes
even among treated patients with hypertension. Health system
factors include (1) inadequate health system capacity for early
diagnosis due to an increasing number of patients, (2)
inequitable distribution of health care facilities affecting
access, (3) financial sustainability of the National Health
Insurance Scheme and delays in reimbursement of claims to
facilities that affect the health system's ability to provide
timely management of hypertension and (4) health care facilities

months and 5.68 (95% CI 4.77-6.59) mmHg at 12 months' follow-up.
High intensity interventions were more effective, resulting in a
2.6 (95% CI 0.5-4.7) (at 6 months) and 3.3 (95% CI 1.4-5.1) (at
12 months) lower systolic blood pressure, but were also more
costly, resulting in €170 (95% CI 56-284) higher costs at 6
months and €342 (95% CI 128-556) at 12 months. Programs that
included a high volume of participants showed €203 (95% CI
99-307) less costs than those with a low volume at 6 months, and
€525 (95% CI 299-751) at 12 months without showing a difference
in systolic blood pressure. Studies that implemented eHealth as a
partial replacement, rather than addition to usual care, were
also less costly (€119 (95% CI -38-201 at 6 months) and €346
(95% CI 261-430 at 12 months)) without being less effective.
Evidence on eHealth programs for hypertension is ambiguous,
heterogeneity on effectiveness and costs is high (I2 = 56-98%).
CONCLUSION: Effective eHealth with limited additional costs
should focus on high intensity interventions, involve a large
number of participants and use eHealth as a partial replacement
for usual care.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To quantify the health and economic burden of
hypertension in the South African public healthcare system.
SETTING: All inpatient, outpatient and rehabilitative care
received in the national public healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS:
Adults, aged 20 years, who receive care in the public
healthcare system. OUTCOMES: Worksheet-based models synthesised
data from multiple sources to estimate the burden of disease,
direct healthcare costs, and societal costs associated with
hypertension. Results were disaggregated by sex. RESULTS:
Approximately 8.22 million (30.8%, 95% CI 29.5% to 32.1%)
South African adults with no private health insurance have
hypertension. Hypertension was estimated to cause 14 000 (95%
CI 11 100 to 17 200) ischaemic heart disease events, 13 300
(95% CI 10 600 to 16 300) strokes and 6100 (95% CI 4970 to
7460) cases of chronic kidney disease annually. Rates of
hypertension, hypertension-related stroke and
hypertension-related chronic kidney disease were greater for
women compared with men.The direct healthcare costs associated
with hypertension were estimated to be ZAR 10.1 billion (95% CI
8.98 to 11.3 billion) or US0.711 billion (95% CI 0.633 to
0.793 billion). Societal costs were estimated to be ZAR 29.4
billion (95% CI 26.0 to 33.2 billion) or US2.08 billion (95%
CI 1.83 to 2.34 billion). Direct healthcare costs were greater
for women (ZAR 6.11 billion or US0.431 billion) compared with
men (ZAR 3.97 billion or US0.280 billion). Conversely, societal
costs were lower for women (ZAR 10.5 billion or US0.743
billion) compared with men (ZAR 18.9 billion or US1.33
billion). CONCLUSION: Hypertension exerts a heavy health and
economic burden on South Africa. Establishing cost-effective
best practice guidelines for hypertension treatment requires
further research. Such research will be essential if South
Africa is to make progress in its efforts to implement universal
healthcare.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare,
progressive, and fatal disease associated with considerable
overall clinical and economic burden. Although the direct health
care costs of PAH have been well described, there are few data
regarding indirect costs and productivity loss associated with
PAH. Patient data were assessed until the earliest of death, end
of full-time employment, end of continuous enrollment, or end of
study period. OBJECTIVES: To update data on the direct burden and
address the knowledge gap regarding the indirect burden
associated with PAH. METHODS: This is a retrospective
case-control study with prevalent and incident patients with PAH
aged 18-64 years identified from the MarketScan Commercial and
Health and Productivity management datasets during the
identification period (January 1, 2016, to November 30, 2018).
Patients were required to have continuous enrollment for 12
months or longer from the baseline period and 1 month or longer
from the follow-up (post-index) period. Among patients with PAH
(cases), the first observed PAH diagnosis claim date during the
identification period was the index date. Patients without PAH
(controls) were selected and assigned a random index date during
the same period. Controls were matched 1:1 by age, sex, and
region to prevalent and incident PAH cases. Per patient per month
(PPPM), all-cause health care resource utilization, costs, and
short-term disability (STD) were examined for cases and controls
during the follow-up period. Multivariable analysis was performed
using the generalized linear model to determine the adjusted
direct and indirect health care utilization and costs. RESULTS: A
total of 1,293 prevalent and 455 incident patients with PAH were
identified. During the follow-up period, prevalent patients with
PAH had significantly higher total mean all-cause health care
costs (9,915 vs 359, P < 0.0001) and inpatient length of stay
(0.63 vs 0.02 days, P < 0.0001) PPPM as compared with controls.
Prevalent patients with PAH had significantly longer STD (6.0 vs
1.5 days, P < 0.0001) and higher STD-related costs (1,226 vs
277, P < 0.0001) PPPM as compared with controls. Incident
patients with PAH had significantly higher total mean all-cause
health care costs (9,353 vs 336, P < 0.0001) and inpatient
length of stay (0.92 vs 0.01 days, P < 0.0001) PPPM as compared
with controls. Incident patients with PAH also had longer STD
(8.1 vs 1.5 days, P < 0.0001) and higher STD-related costs
(1,706 vs 263, P < 0.0001), as compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that incident and prevalent
patients with PAH had significantly higher direct and indirect
health care resource utilization and costs as well as
productivity loss compared with patients without PAH.

   abstract = {Treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has evolved
over the past decade, including approval of new medications and
growing evidence to support earlier use of combination therapy.
Despite these changes, few studies have assessed real-world
treatment patterns, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and
costs among people with PAH using recent data. We conducted a
retrospective cohort study using administrative claims from the
HealthCore Integrated Research Database\textregistered\{\}. Adult
members with claims for a PAH diagnosis, right heart
catheterization, and who initiated PAH treatment (index date)
between October 1, 2015 and November 30, 2020 were identified.
Members had to be continuously enrolled in the health plan for 6
months before the index date (baseline) and 30 days after.
Treatment patterns, HCRU, and costs were described. A total of
843 members with PAH (mean age 62.3 years, 64.2% female) were
included. Only 21.0% of members received combination therapy as
their first-line treatment, while most members (54.6%) received
combination therapy as second-line treatment. All-cause HCRU
remained high after treatment initiation with 58.0% of members
having 1 hospitalization and 41.3% with 1 emergency
room visit. Total all-cause costs declined from 15,117 per
patient per month at baseline to 14,201 after treatment
initiation, with decreased medical costs (14,208 vs. 6,349)
more than offsetting increased pharmacy costs (909 vs. 7,852).
In summary, despite growing evidence supporting combination
therapy, most members with PAH initiated treatment with
monotherapy. Total costs decreased following treatment, driven
by a reduction in medical costs even with increases in pharmacy
costs.},

diseases. Lifestyle modification is a significant component of
nonpharmacological treatments for hypertension. We previously
reported the clinical efficacy of digital therapeutics (DTx) in
the HERB-DH1 trial. However, there is still a lack of
cost-effectiveness assessments evaluating the impact of
prescription DTx. This study aimed to analyze the
cost-effectiveness of using prescription DTx in treating
hypertension. We developed a monthly cycle Markov model and
conducted Monte Carlo simulations using the HERB-DH1 trial data
to investigate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the cost
of DTx for hypertension plus guideline-based lifestyle
modification consultation treatment as usual (TAU), comparing
DTx + TAU and TAU-only groups with a lifetime horizon. The model
inputs were obtained from the HERB-DH1 trial, published or
publicly available data, and expert assumptions. The incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY was used as the
benchmark for cost-effectiveness. We performed probabilistic
sensitivity analyses (PSAs) using the Monte Carlo simulation
with two million sets. The DTx + TAU strategy produced 18.778
QALYs and was associated with ¥3,924,075 (34,122) expected
costs, compared with 18.686 QALYs and ¥3,813,358 (33,160)
generated by the TAU-only strategy over a lifetime horizon,
resulting in an ICER of ¥1,199,880 (10,434)/QALY gained for DTx
+ TAU. The monthly cost and attrition rate of DTx for
hypertension have a significant impact on ICERs. In the PSA, the
probability of the DTx arm being a cost-effective option was
87.8% at a threshold value of ¥5 million (43,478)/QALY gained.
In conclusion, the DTx + TAU strategy was more cost-effective
than the TAU-only strategy.},

   abstract = {Background Long-term disorders are the main challenge facing health-care systems worldwide, but health systems are largely configured for individual diseases rather than multimorbidity. We examined the distribution of multimorbidity, and of comorbidity of physical and mental health disorders, in relation to age and socioeconomic deprivation. Methods In a cross-sectional study we extracted data on 40 morbidities from a database of 1 751 841 people registered with 314 medical practices in Scotland as of March, 2007. We analysed the data according to the number of morbidities, disorder type (physical or mental), sex, age, and socioeconomic status. We defined multimorbidity as the presence of two or more disorders. Findings 42.2% (95% CI 42.1-42.3) of all patients had one or more morbidities, and 23.2% (23.08-23.21) were multimorbid. Although the prevalence of multimorbidity increased substantially with age and was present in most people aged 65 years and older, the absolute number of people with multimorbidity was higher in those younger than 65 years (210 500 vs 194 996). Onset of multimorbidity occurred 10-15 years earlier in people living in the most deprived areas compared with the most affluent, with socioeconomic deprivation particularly associated with multimorbidity that included mental health disorders (prevalence of both physical and mental health disorder 11.0%, 95% CI 10.9-11.2% in most deprived area vs 5.9%, 5.8%-6.0% in least deprived). The presence of a mental health disorder increased as the number of physical morbidities increased (adjusted odds ratio 6.74, 95% CI 6.59-6.90 for five or more disorders vs 1.95, 1.93-1.98 for one disorder), and was much greater in more deprived than in less deprived people (2.28, 2.21-2.32 vs 1.08, 1.05-1.11). Interpretation Our findings challenge the single-disease framework by which most health care, medical research, and medical education is configured. A complementary strategy is needed, supporting generalist clinicians to provide personalised, comprehensive continuity of care, especially in socioeconomically deprived areas.

   abstract = {Objectives: The economic burden of multimorbidity is considerable. This review analyzed the methods of cost-of-illness (COI) studies and summarized the economic outcomes of multimorbidity. Methods: A systematic review (2000–2016) was performed, which was registered with Prospero, reported according to PRISMA, and used a quality checklist adapted for COI studies. The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed COI studies on multimorbidity, whereas the exclusion criterion was studies focusing on an index disease. Extracted data included the definition, measure, and prevalence of multimorbidity; the number of included health conditions; the age of study population; the variables used in the COI methodology; the percentage of multimorbidity vs. total costs; and the average costs per capita. Results: Among the 26 included articles, 14 defined multimorbidity as a simple count of 2 or more conditions. Methodologies used to derive the costs were markedly different. Given different healthcare systems, OOP payments of multimorbidity varied across countries. In the 17 and 12 studies with cut-offs of ≥2 and ≥3 conditions, respectively, the ratios of multimorbidity to non-multimorbidity costs ranged from 2–16 to 2–10. Among the ten studies that provided cost breakdowns, studies with and without a societal perspective attributed the largest percentage of multimorbidity costs to social care and inpatient care/medicine, respectively. Conclusion: Multimorbidity was associated with considerable economic burden. Synthesising the cost of multimorbidity was challenging due to multiple definitions of multimorbidity and heterogeneity in COI methods. Count method was most popular to define multimorbidity. There is consistent evidence that multimorbidity was associated with higher costs.},

For patients, there is also a high financial burden due to direct and indirect costs arising from their multimorbidity. It is unclear how this financial burden affects patients. This study aims to synthesise qualitative evidence exploring the experience of financial burden from the perspective of patients with multimorbidity.  Methods: The review will be reported using the ENTREQ guidelines. A systematic search of Lilacs, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts will be conducted using a predefined search strategy. A search of fourteen pre-specified websites will be conducted for grey literature. Forward and backward citation checking of included studies will be conducted also. Studies will be included if they contain primary qualitative research and reference the experience of financial burden from the perspective of adult (≥ 18 years) community dwelling patients with multimorbidity. Studies from any country and in any language will be included. Titles and abstracts of search results will be screened; if a study appears relevant, then full-texts will be screened for eligibility. Study characteristics of included articles will be extracted. Study quality will be evaluated using the critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative research. These three processes will be carried out by two reviewers independently. Thematic-synthesis will be used to analyse data. This will be carried out by one reviewer and cross-checked by a second reviewer. The GRADE CERQual approach will be used to assess the overall confidence in the evidence.  Discussion: This review will identify evidence on the experiences of financial burden for patients with multimorbidity and forms part of a project to support consideration of financial burden for patients in the development of clinical guidelines in Ireland.
