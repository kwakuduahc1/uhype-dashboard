	abstract = {Introduction: Multimorbidity is increasingly important due to its high disease burden, prevalence and related high healthcare utilisation. For patients, there is also a high financial burden due to direct and indirect costs arising from their multimorbidity. It is unclear how this financial burden affects patients. This study aims to synthesise qualitative evidence exploring the experience of financial burden from the perspective of patients with multimorbidity.  Methods: The review will be reported using the ENTREQ guidelines. A systematic search of Lilacs, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts will be conducted using a predefined search strategy. A search of fourteen pre-specified websites will be conducted for grey literature. Forward and backward citation checking of included studies will be conducted also. Studies will be included if they contain primary qualitative research and reference the experience of financial burden from the perspective of adult (≥ 18 years) community dwelling patients with multimorbidity. Studies from any country and in any language will be included. Titles and abstracts of search results will be screened; if a study appears relevant, then full-texts will be screened for eligibility. Study characteristics of included articles will be extracted. Study quality will be evaluated using the critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative research. These three processes will be carried out by two reviewers independently. Thematic-synthesis will be used to analyse data. This will be carried out by one reviewer and cross-checked by a second reviewer. The GRADE CERQual approach will be used to assess the overall confidence in the evidence.  Discussion: This review will identify evidence on the experiences of financial burden for patients with multimorbidity and forms part of a project to support consideration of financial burden for patients in the development of clinical guidelines in Ireland.

	abstract = {Objectives: The economic burden of multimorbidity is considerable. This review analyzed the methods of cost-of-illness (COI) studies and summarized the economic outcomes of multimorbidity. Methods: A systematic review (2000–2016) was performed, which was registered with Prospero, reported according to PRISMA, and used a quality checklist adapted for COI studies. The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed COI studies on multimorbidity, whereas the exclusion criterion was studies focusing on an index disease. Extracted data included the definition, measure, and prevalence of multimorbidity; the number of included health conditions; the age of study population; the variables used in the COI methodology; the percentage of multimorbidity vs. total costs; and the average costs per capita. Results: Among the 26 included articles, 14 defined multimorbidity as a simple count of 2 or more conditions. Methodologies used to derive the costs were markedly different. Given different healthcare systems, OOP payments of multimorbidity varied across countries. In the 17 and 12 studies with cut-offs of ≥2 and ≥3 conditions, respectively, the ratios of multimorbidity to non-multimorbidity costs ranged from 2–16 to 2–10. Among the ten studies that provided cost breakdowns, studies with and without a societal perspective attributed the largest percentage of multimorbidity costs to social care and inpatient care/medicine, respectively. Conclusion: Multimorbidity was associated with considerable economic burden. Synthesising the cost of multimorbidity was challenging due to multiple definitions of multimorbidity and heterogeneity in COI methods. Count method was most popular to define multimorbidity. There is consistent evidence that multimorbidity was associated with higher costs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Long-term disorders are the main challenge facing health-care systems worldwide, but health systems are largely configured for individual diseases rather than multimorbidity. We examined the distribution of multimorbidity, and of comorbidity of physical and mental health disorders, in relation to age and socioeconomic deprivation. METHODS In a cross-sectional study we extracted data on 40 morbidities from a database of 1,751,841 people registered with 314 medical practices in Scotland as of March, 2007. We analysed the data according to the number of morbidities, disorder type (physical or mental), sex, age, and socioeconomic status. We defined multimorbidity as the presence of two or more disorders. FINDINGS 42·2\% (95\% CI 42·1-42·3) of all patients had one or more morbidities, and 23·2\% (23·08-23·21) were multimorbid. Although the prevalence of multimorbidity increased substantially with age and was present in most people aged 65 years and older, the absolute number of people with multimorbidity was higher in those younger than 65 years (210,500 vs 194,996). Onset of multimorbidity occurred 10-15 years earlier in people living in the most deprived areas compared with the most affluent, with socioeconomic deprivation particularly associated with multimorbidity that included mental health disorders (prevalence of both physical and mental health disorder 11·0\%, 95\% CI 10·9-11·2\% in most deprived area vs 5·9\%, 5·8\%-6·0\% in least deprived). The presence of a mental health disorder increased as the number of physical morbidities increased (adjusted odds ratio 6·74, 95\% CI 6·59-6·90 for five or more disorders vs 1·95, 1·93-1·98 for one disorder), and was much greater in more deprived than in less deprived people (2·28, 2·21-2·32 vs 1·08, 1·05-1·11). INTERPRETATION Our findings challenge the single-disease framework by which most health care, medical research, and medical education is configured. A complementary strategy is needed, supporting generalist clinicians to provide personalised, comprehensive continuity of care, especially in socioeconomically deprived areas.

Lifestyle modification is a significant component of nonpharmacological treatments for hypertension. We previously reported the clinical efficacy of digital therapeutics (DTx) in the HERB-DH1 trial. However, there is still a lack of cost-effectiveness assessments evaluating the impact of prescription DTx. This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of using prescription DTx in treating hypertension. We developed a monthly cycle Markov model and conducted Monte Carlo simulations using the HERB-DH1 trial data to investigate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the cost of DTx for hypertension plus guideline-based lifestyle modification consultation treatment as usual (TAU), comparing DTx + TAU and TAU-only groups with a lifetime horizon. The model inputs were obtained from the HERB-DH1 trial, published or publicly available data, and expert assumptions. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY was used as the benchmark for cost-effectiveness. We performed probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) using the Monte Carlo simulation with two million sets. The DTx + TAU strategy produced 18.778 QALYs and was associated with ¥3,924,075 (\$34,122) expected costs, compared with 18.686 QALYs and ¥3,813,358 (\$33,160) generated by the TAU-only strategy over a lifetime horizon, resulting in an ICER of ¥1,199,880 (\$10,434)/QALY gained for DTx + TAU. The monthly cost and attrition rate of DTx for hypertension have a significant impact on ICERs. In the PSA, the probability of the DTx arm being a cost-effective option was 87.8\% at a threshold value of ¥5 million (\$43,478)/QALY gained. In conclusion, the DTx + TAU strategy was more cost-effective than the TAU-only strategy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has evolved
over the past decade, including approval of new medications and
growing evidence to support earlier use of combination therapy.
Despite these changes, few studies have assessed real-world
treatment patterns, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and
costs among people with PAH using recent data. We conducted a
retrospective cohort study using administrative claims from the
HealthCore Integrated Research Database{\textbackslash}textregistered\{\}. Adult
members with claims for a PAH diagnosis, right heart
catheterization, and who initiated PAH treatment (index date)
between October 1, 2015 and November 30, 2020 were identified.
Members had to be continuously enrolled in the health plan for 6
months before the index date (baseline) and 30 days after.
Treatment patterns, HCRU, and costs were described. A total of
843 members with PAH (mean age 62.3 years, 64.2\% female) were
included. Only 21.0\% of members received combination therapy as
their first-line treatment, while most members (54.6\%) received
combination therapy as second-line treatment. All-cause HCRU
remained high after treatment initiation with 58.0\% of members
having 1 hospitalization and 41.3\% with 1 emergency
room visit. Total all-cause costs declined from 15,117 per
patient per month at baseline to 14,201 after treatment
initiation, with decreased medical costs (14,208 vs. 6,349)
more than offsetting increased pharmacy costs (909 vs. 7,852).
In summary, despite growing evidence supporting combination
therapy, most members with PAH initiated treatment with
monotherapy. Total costs decreased following treatment, driven
by a reduction in medical costs even with increases in pharmacy
costs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive, and fatal disease associated with considerable overall clinical and economic burden. Although the direct health care costs of PAH have been well described, there are few data regarding indirect costs and productivity loss associated with PAH. Patient data were assessed until the earliest of death, end of full-time employment, end of continuous enrollment, or end of study period. OBJECTIVES: To update data on the direct burden and address the knowledge gap regarding the indirect burden associated with PAH. METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study with prevalent and incident patients with PAH aged 18-64 years identified from the MarketScan Commercial and Health and Productivity management datasets during the identification period (January 1, 2016, to November 30, 2018). Patients were required to have continuous enrollment for 12 months or longer from the baseline period and 1 month or longer from the follow-up (post-index) period. Among patients with PAH (cases), the first observed PAH diagnosis claim date during the identification period was the index date. Patients without PAH (controls) were selected and assigned a random index date during the same period. Controls were matched 1:1 by age, sex, and region to prevalent and incident PAH cases. Per patient per month (PPPM), all-cause health care resource utilization, costs, and short-term disability (STD) were examined for cases and controls during the follow-up period. Multivariable analysis was performed using the generalized linear model to determine the adjusted direct and indirect health care utilization and costs. RESULTS: A total of 1,293 prevalent and 455 incident patients with PAH were identified. During the follow-up period, prevalent patients with PAH had significantly higher total mean all-cause health care costs (\$9,915 vs \$359, P {\textless} 0.0001) and inpatient length of stay (0.63 vs 0.02 days, P {\textless} 0.0001) PPPM as compared with controls. Prevalent patients with PAH had significantly longer STD (6.0 vs 1.5 days, P {\textless} 0.0001) and higher STD-related costs (\$1,226 vs \$277, P {\textless} 0.0001) PPPM as compared with controls. Incident patients with PAH had significantly higher total mean all-cause health care costs (\$9,353 vs \$336, P {\textless} 0.0001) and inpatient length of stay (0.92 vs 0.01 days, P {\textless} 0.0001) PPPM as compared with controls. Incident patients with PAH also had longer STD (8.1 vs 1.5 days, P {\textless} 0.0001) and higher STD-related costs (\$1,706 vs \$263, P {\textless} 0.0001), as compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that incident and prevalent patients with PAH had significantly higher direct and indirect health care resource utilization and costs as well as productivity loss compared with patients without PAH.

hypertension in the South African public healthcare system.
SETTING: All inpatient, outpatient and rehabilitative care
received in the national public healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS:
Adults, aged 20 years, who receive care in the public
healthcare system. OUTCOMES: Worksheet-based models synthesised
data from multiple sources to estimate the burden of disease,
direct healthcare costs, and societal costs associated with
hypertension. Results were disaggregated by sex. RESULTS:
Approximately 8.22 million (30.8\%, 95\% CI 29.5\% to 32.1\%)
South African adults with no private health insurance have
hypertension. Hypertension was estimated to cause 14 000 (95\%
CI 11 100 to 17 200) ischaemic heart disease events, 13 300
(95\% CI 10 600 to 16 300) strokes and 6100 (95\% CI 4970 to
7460) cases of chronic kidney disease annually. Rates of
hypertension, hypertension-related stroke and
hypertension-related chronic kidney disease were greater for
women compared with men.The direct healthcare costs associated
with hypertension were estimated to be ZAR 10.1 billion (95\% CI
8.98 to 11.3 billion) or US0.711 billion (95\% CI 0.633 to
0.793 billion). Societal costs were estimated to be ZAR 29.4
billion (95\% CI 26.0 to 33.2 billion) or US2.08 billion (95\%
CI 1.83 to 2.34 billion). Direct healthcare costs were greater
for women (ZAR 6.11 billion or US0.431 billion) compared with
men (ZAR 3.97 billion or US0.280 billion). Conversely, societal
costs were lower for women (ZAR 10.5 billion or US0.743
billion) compared with men (ZAR 18.9 billion or US1.33
billion). CONCLUSION: Hypertension exerts a heavy health and
economic burden on South Africa. Establishing cost-effective
best practice guidelines for hypertension treatment requires
further research. Such research will be essential if South
Africa is to make progress in its efforts to implement universal
healthcare.},

This study aims to review the evidence on the effectiveness and costs of eHealth for hypertension and assess commonalities in programs with high effect and low additional cost. RESULTS Overall, the incremental decrease in systolic blood pressure using eHealth, compared to usual care, was 3.87 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.98-4.77) mmHg at 6 months and 5.68 (95\% CI 4.77-6.59) mmHg at 12 months' follow-up. High intensity interventions were more effective, resulting in a 2.6 (95\% CI 0.5-4.7) (at 6 months) and 3.3 (95\% CI 1.4-5.1) (at 12 months) lower systolic blood pressure, but were also more costly, resulting in €170 (95\% CI 56-284) higher costs at 6 months and €342 (95\% CI 128-556) at 12 months. Programs that included a high volume of participants showed €203 (95\% CI 99-307) less costs than those with a low volume at 6 months, and €525 (95\% CI 299-751) at 12 months without showing a difference in systolic blood pressure. Studies that implemented eHealth as a partial replacement, rather than addition to usual care, were also less costly (€119 (95\% CI -38-201 at 6 months) and €346 (95\% CI 261-430 at 12 months)) without being less effective. Evidence on eHealth programs for hypertension is ambiguous, heterogeneity on effectiveness and costs is high (I2 = 56-98\%). CONCLUSION Effective eHealth with limited additional costs should focus on high intensity interventions, involve a large number of participants and use eHealth as a partial replacement for usual care.},

	volume = {36},
	abstract = {Ghana has signed on to the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goal to achieve universal health coverage (UHC),
ensuring that all individuals receive the health care they
require without financial hardship. Achieving that goal is a
difficult task in any setting. The challenges are further
exacerbated by a changing disease landscape, as the burden of
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is increasing and creating a
dual burden along with infectious diseases. This study explores
the existing health system for delivering hypertension care and
the challenges of delivering UHC for hypertension in Ghana.
Document analysis of national health reports, policies and
legislations along with a review of research articles was
conducted to explore the challenges of delivering UHC for NCDs
in Ghana, and hypertension in particular. The main themes and
indicators related to the challenges of delivering UHC for
hypertension were mapped and analysed. The main challenges to
delivering UHC for hypertension can be grouped into population
and patient, on the one hand, and health system factors, on the
other. Population and patient factors include (1) unhealthy
lifestyles overburdening the health system, (2) poor
health-seeking behaviour and (3) poor adherence to medication,
which has led to uncontrolled cases and poor clinical outcomes
even among treated patients with hypertension. Health system
factors include (1) inadequate health system capacity for early
diagnosis due to an increasing number of patients, (2)
inequitable distribution of health care facilities affecting
access, (3) financial sustainability of the National Health
Insurance Scheme and delays in reimbursement of claims to
facilities that affect the health system's ability to provide
timely management of hypertension and (4) health care facilities
and practitioners' use of non-standardized and uncalibrated
blood pressure measuring equipment. Ghana therefore will need to
make important decisions to overcome operational and financial
challenges on its path to UHC.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Limited evidence exists regarding the relationships
between adherence, as defined in Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA)
medication adherence measures, health care utilization, and
economic outcomes. PQA adherence measures for hypertension,
cholesterol, and diabetes are of particular interest given their
use in Medicare Star Ratings to evaluate health plan
performance.The objective of this study was to assess the
relationship between adherence and utilization and cost among
Medicare Supplemental beneficiaries included in the
aforementioned PQA measures over a 1-year period.Retrospective
cohort study.Three cohorts (hypertension, cholesterol, and
diabetes) of eligible individuals from the Truven Health
MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Research Databases
(2009-2015) were used to assess associations between adherence
and health care expenditure and utilization for Medicare
Supplemental beneficiaries.Generalized linear models with log
link and negative binomial (utilization) or gamma (expenditure)
distributions assessed relationships between adherence
(80\% proportion of days covered) and health care
utilization and expenditure (in 2015 US dollars) while adjusting
for confounding variables. Beta coefficients were used to
compute cost ratios and rate ratios.Adherence for all 3 disease
cohorts was associated with lower outpatient and inpatient
visits. During the 1-year study period, adherence was associated
with lower outpatient, inpatient, and total expenditures across
the cohorts, ranging from 9\% lower outpatient costs (diabetes
cohort) to 41.9\% lower inpatient costs (hypertension cohort).
Savings of up to \$324.53 per member per month in total
expenditure were observed for the hypertension cohort.Our
findings indicate adherence is associated with lower health care
utilization and expenditures within 1 year.},

Community-based Hypertension Improvement Project (ComHIP)
compared with standard hypertension care in Ghana. DESIGN:
Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model. SETTING: Lower
Manya Krobo, Eastern Region, Ghana. INTERVENTION: We evaluated
ComHIP, an intervention with multiple components, including:
community-based education on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
factors and healthy lifestyles; community-based screening and
monitoring of blood pressure by licensed chemical sellers and
CVD nurses; community-based diagnosis, treatment, counselling,
follow-up and referral of hypertension patients by CVD nurses;
telemedicine consultation by CVD nurses and referral of patients
with severe hypertension and/or organ damage to a physician;
information and communication technologies messages for healthy
lifestyles, treatment adherence support and treatment refill
reminders for hypertension patients; Commcare, a cloud-based
health records system linked to short-message service
(SMS)/voice messaging for treatment adherence, reminders and
health messaging. ComHIP was evaluated under two scale-up
scenarios: (1) ComHIP as currently implemented with support from
international partners and (2) ComHIP under full local
implementation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per
disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted from a societal
perspective over a time horizon of 10 years. RESULTS: ComHIP is
unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention, with current
ComHIP implementation and ComHIP under full local implementation
costing on average US12 189 and US6530 per DALY averted,
respectively. Results were robust to uncertainty analyses around
model parameters. CONCLUSIONS: High overhead costs and high
patient costs in ComHIP suggest that the societal costs of
ensuring appropriate hypertension care are high and may not
produce sufficient impact to achieve cost-effective
implementation. However, these results are limited by the
evidence quality of the effectiveness estimates, which comes
from observational data rather than from randomised controlled
study design.},

	abstract = {Importance: Hypertension is highly prevalent in low- and
middle-income countries, and it is an important preventable risk
factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Understanding the
economic benefits of a hypertension control program is valuable
to decision-makers. Objective: To evaluate the long-term
cost-effectiveness of a multicomponent hypertension management
program compared with usual care among patients with
hypertension receiving care in public clinics in Argentina from
a health care system perspective. Design, Setting, and
Participants: This economic evaluation used a Markov model to
estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypertension management
program among adult patients with uncontrolled hypertension in a
low-income setting. Patient-level data (743 individuals for
multicomponent intervention; 689 for usual care) from the
Hypertension Control Program in Argentina trial (HCPIA) were
used to estimate treatment effects and the risk of CVD. Three
health states were included in each strategy: (1) low risk of
CVD, (2) high risk of CVD, and (3) death. The total time horizon
was the lifetime, and each cycle lasted 6 months. Main Outcomes
and Measures: Model inputs were based on trial data and other
published sources. Cost and utilities were discounted at a rate
of 5\% annually. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)
between the multicomponent intervention and usual care was
calculated using the difference in costs in 2017 international
dollars (INT ) divided by the difference in effectiveness in
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). One-way sensitivity
analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed
to assess the uncertainty and robustness of the results.
Results: In the original trial, the 743 participants in the
intervention group (349 [47.0\%] men) had a mean (SD) age of
56.2 (12.0) years, and the 689 participants in the control group
(311 [45.1\%] men) had a mean (SD) age of 56.2 (11.7) years. In
the base-case analysis, the HCPIA program yielded 8.42
discounted QALYs and accrued INT 3096 discounted costs, while
usual care yielded 8.29 discounted QALYs and accrued INT 2473
discounted costs. The ICER for the HCPIA program was INT
4907/QALY gained. The model results remained robust in
sensitivity analyses, and the model was most sensitive to
parameters of program costs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this
study, the HCPIA multicomponent intervention vs usual care was a
cost-effective strategy to improve hypertension management and
reduce the risk of associated CVD among patients with
hypertension who received services at public clinics in
Argentina. This intervention program is likely transferable to
other settings in Argentina or other lower- and middle-income
countries.},

Black-owned barbershops significantly improved blood pressure
control in non-Hispanic Black men with uncontrolled hypertension
at baseline. In this analysis, 10-year health outcomes and
health care costs of 1 year of the LABBPS intervention versus

hypertension care processes projected blood pressure,
medication-related adverse events, fatal and nonfatal
cardiovascular disease events, and noncardiovascular disease
death in LABBPS participants. Program costs, total direct health
care costs (2019 US dollars), and quality-adjusted life-years
(QALYs) were estimated for the LABBPS intervention and control
arms from a health care sector perspective over a 10-year
horizon. Future costs and QALYs were discounted 3\% annually.
High and intermediate cost-effectiveness thresholds were defined
as {\textless}\$50 000 and {\textless}\$150 000 per QALY gained, respectively.
RESULTS: At 10 years, the intervention was projected to cost an
average of \$2356 (95\% uncertainty interval, -\$264 to \$4611)
more per participant than the control arm and gain 0.06 (95\%
uncertainty interval, 0.01-0.10) QALYs. The LABBPS intervention
was highly cost-effective, with a mean cost of \$42 717 per QALY
gained (58\% probability of being highly and 96\% of being at
least intermediately cost-effective). Exclusive use of generic
drugs improved the cost-effectiveness to \$17 162 per QALY
gained. The LABBPS intervention would be only intermediately
cost-effective if pharmacists were less likely to intensify
antihypertensive medications when systolic blood pressure was
150 mm Hg or if pharmacist weekly time driving to
barbershops increased. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension care delivered
by clinical pharmacists in Black barbershops is a highly
cost-effective way to improve blood pressure control in Black

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), a global
public health problem and the primary risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases, has a significant financial impact on
health systems. In Brazil, the prevalence of SAH is 23.7\%,
which caused 203,000 deaths and 3.9 million DALYs in 2015.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost of SAH and circulatory system
diseases attributable to SAH from the perspective of the
Brazilian public health system in 2019. METHODS: A
prevalence-based cost-of-illness was conducted using a top-down
approach. The population attributable risk (PAR) was used to
estimate the proportion of circulatory system diseases
attributable to SAH. The direct medical costs were obtained from
official Ministry of Health of Brazil records and literature
parameters, including the three levels of care (primary,
secondary, and tertiary). Deterministic univariate analyses were
also conducted. RESULTS: The total cost of SAH and the
proportion of circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH
was Int\$ 581,135,374.73, varying between Int\$ 501,553,022.21
and Int\$ 776,183,338.06. In terms only of SAH costs at all
healthcare levels (Int\$ 493,776,445.89), 97.3\% were incurred
in primary care, especially for antihypertensive drugs provided
free of charge by the Brazilian public health system (Int\$
363,888,540.14). Stroke accounted for the highest cost
attributable to SAH and the third highest PAR, representing 47\%
of the total cost of circulatory diseases attributable to SAH.
Prevalence was the parameter that most affected sensitivity
analyses, accounting for 36\% of all the cost variation.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the main Brazilian strategy to
combat SAH was implemented in primary care, namely access to
free antihypertensive drugs and multiprofessional teams, acting
jointly to promote care and prevent and control SAH.},

main risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Since the
incidence of hypertension is rising in Ethiopia, one may expect
that the household's cost of healthcare services related to the
disease will increase in the near future. Yet the cost
associated with the disease is not known. We aimed to estimate
the total cost of hypertension illness and identify associated
factors among patients attending hospitals in Southwest Shewa
zone, Oromia regional state, Ethiopia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An
institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed to
conduct the study from 13 August to 2 September 2018. All
hypertensive patients aged 18 years and older who were on
follow-up were eligible for this study. The total cost of
hypertension illness was estimated by summing the direct and
indirect costs. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression
analyses were performed to identify factors associated with
hypertension costs of illnesses. RESULTS: A total of 349
patients participated in the study. The mean monthly total cost
of hypertension illness was US\$ 22.3 (95\% CI, 21.3-23.3).
Direct and indirect costs constitute 51\% and 49\% of the total
cost, respectively. The mean direct cost of hypertension illness
per patient per month was US\$ 11.39 (95\% CI, 10.6-12.1). Out
of these, drugs comprised higher cost (31\%), followed by food
(25\%). The mean indirect cost per patient per month was US\$
10.89 (95\% CI, 10.4-11.4). In this study, the primary
educational status, family size (4-6 and {\textgreater}6), distance from
hospital (10 km), the presence of a companion and stage of
hypertension (stage two) of patients were identified as the
predictors of the cost of hypertension illnesses. CONCLUSION:
The cost of hypertension illness was very high when compared to
the monthly income of households, exposing patients to
catastrophic costs. Hence, the government should give due
attention to protect patients from catastrophic health
expenditures.},

cardiovascular disease by adapting cost-of-illness methodologies
to estimate the attributable burden of excessive salt intake on
cardiovascular disease. The methodology estimates the changes in
blood pressure that result from each gram change in salt intake
and links diet to the direct and indirect costs of
cardiovascular diseases (CVD), such as coronary heart disease,
stroke, hypertensive disease, aortic aneurysm, heart failure,
pulmonary embolism, and rheumatic heart, using the relative
risks of disease and the prevalence of salt consumption in the
population. The methodology includes (a) identifying major
diseases and conditions related to excessive salt intake and
relevant economic cost data available, (b) quantifying the
relationship between the prevalence of excessive salt intake and
the associated risk of disease morbidity and mortality using
population attributable risks (PAR), (c) using PARs to estimate
the share of total costs directly attributed to excessive salt
intake, and (d) undertaking a sensitivity analysis of key
epidemiological and economic parameters. The costing tool has
estimated that, in 2013, US 102.0 million (95\% uncertainty
interval-UI: US 96.2-107.8 million) in public hospitalizations
could be saved if the average salt intake of Brazilians were
reduced to 5 g/d, corresponding to 9.4\% (95\% UI: 8.9\%-9.9\%)
of the total hospital costs by CVDs. This methodology of cost of
illness associated with salt consumption can be adapted to
estimate the burden of other dietary risk factors and support
prevention and control policies in Brazil and in other

	abstract = {Adherence to therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension is
essential to optimize patient outcomes, but data on real-world
adherence to different pulmonary arterial hypertension drug
classes are limited. This retrospective database analysis
evaluated relationships between adherence, hospitalization, and
healthcare costs in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients
treated with endothelin receptor antagonists or
phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors. From the IQVIA Adjudicated
Health Plan Database, patients with pulmonary arterial
hypertension were identified based on diagnostic codes and
prescriptions for endothelin receptor antagonists (ambrisentan,
bosentan, macitentan) or phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors
(sildenafil, tadalafil) approved for pulmonary arterial
hypertension. Patients were assigned to the class of their most
recently initiated (index) pulmonary arterial hypertension
therapy between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2015. Medication
adherence was measured by proportion of days covered; patients
with proportion of days covered 80\% were considered
adherent. The proportion of adherent patients was higher for
endothelin receptor antagonists (571/755; 75.6\%) than for
phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (970/1578; 61.5\%; P {\textless}
0.0001). In both groups, hospitalizations declined as proportion
of days covered increased. Among adherent patients, those on
endothelin receptor antagonists had a significantly lower
hospitalization rate than those on phosphodiesterase type-5
inhibitors (23.1\% versus 28.5\%, P = 0. 0218), fewer
hospitalizations (mean (standard deviation) 0.4 (0.8) versus 0.5
(0.9); P = 0.02), and mean hospitalization costs during the
six-month post-index (9510 versus 15,726, P = 0.0318).
Increasing adherence reduced hospitalization risk more for
endothelin receptor antagonists than for phosphodiesterase
type-5 inhibitors (hazard ratio 0.176 versus 0.549, P = 0.001).
Rates and numbers of rehospitalizations within 30 days
post-discharge were similar between groups. Mean total costs
were higher with endothelin receptor antagonists than
phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors in all patients (91,328
versus 72,401, P = 0.0003) and in adherent patients (88,867
versus 56,300, P {\textless} 0.0001), driven by higher drug costs.},

two health systems in Massachusetts. We measured the UBP,
insurance instability, and race of 43,785 adult primary care

found higher rates of UBP for blacks and Hispanics at each time
point over the entire 9 years. Insurance instability was
associated with greater rates of UBP. Always uninsured black
patients fared worst, while white and Hispanic patients with
consistent public insurance fared best. CONCLUSIONS: Stable

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Non-communicable diseases impose a significant social,
economic and health burden. Hypertension, the leading
contributor to the global burden of disease and a growing public
health problem worldwide, is one of the most serious
non-communicable diseases. In Ethiopia, empirical evidence on
the economic burden of hypertension is limited. Therefore, this
study aimed to measure the cost of hypertension and associated
factors at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized
hospital, northwest Ethiopia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An
institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 442
adult hypertensive patients using a semi-structured
questionnaire to estimate the direct and indirect costs of
hypertension. The human capital approach was used to calculate
indirect costs. A generalized linear model was fitted to
identify factors associated with the cost of hypertension at a
95\% confidence level and {\textless}0.05 p-value. RESULTS: A total of
442, 56.3\% female and 64.3\% stage one hypertension patients
were included. The total cost of hypertension was ETB 2510.32
(\$91.72)  2152.80 (78.65) per patient per year; The direct
medical and non-medical cost constituted 60.81\% and 12.17\% of
the total cost of hypertension, respectively. Hospitalized
(exp(b)=1.87, p{\textless}0.001), using multidrug (exp(b)=1.32, p{\textless}0.000),
high socioeconomic status (exp(b)=1.41,p{\textless}0.000), college and
above education(exp(b)= 1.35, p{\textless}0.016), government employment
(exp(b)= 1.30, p{\textless}0.012), retirement (exp(b)= 0.71, p{\textless} 0.001) and
co-morbidity (exp(b)= 1.20, p{\textless}0.004) were factors significantly
associated with the cost of hypertension. CONCLUSION: The total
cost of illness of hypertension is high, and direct medical cost
has the highest component of the total cost of illness.
Hospitalization, using multidrug, co-morbidity, attending
college and above education, highest socioeconomic status and
government employment were factors significantly associated with
the high cost of hypertension. Therefore, prevention and early
detection of complications and co-morbidity are essential to
reduce hospitalization and the number of drugs to reduce the
direct medical and indirect costs.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Hypertension, particularly untreated, leads to
serious complications and contributes to high costs incurred by
the whole society. The aim of the review was to carry out a
social and economic comparison of various categories of
hypertension costs from different countries. MATERIAL AND
METHODS: The study was a systematic review. PubMed, Cochrane
Library and Google Scholar databases were searched. Hypertension
costs were analyzed in 8 cost categories. An attempt was made to
determine whether selected economic and social factors (such as
HDI or GDP) influenced hypertension costs. RESULTS: The review
included data from 15 countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Canada,
China, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Jamaica, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico,
Poland, Spain, USA, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. The papers included in
the review were heterogeneous with respect to cost categories,
which made comparisons difficult. The average total costs of
hypertension for all the studied countries, calculated per
person, amounted to 630.14 Int, direct costs - 1,497.36 Int,
and indirect costs - 282.34 Int. The ranking of countries by
costs and by selected economic and social indices points at the
possible relationship between these indices and hypertension
costs. CONCLUSIONS: The costs of hypertension calculated per
country reached the region of several dozen billion Int. Other
sources usually showed lower costs than those presented in this
review. This indicates a growth in costs from year to year and
the future increasing burden on society. Globally uniform cost
terminology and cost calculation standards need to be developed.
That would facilitate making more informed decisions regarding
fund allocation in hypertension management schemes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background Increasing medicines availability and
affordability is a key goal of Brazilian health policies.
``Farmácia Popular'' (FP) Program is one of the government's
key strategies to achieve this goal. Under FP, antihypertension
(HTN) and antiglycemic (DM) medicines have been provided at
subsidized prices in private retail settings since 2006, and
free of charge since 2011. We aim to assess the impact of
sequential changes in FP benefits on patient affordability and
government expenditures for HTN and DM treatment under the FP,
and examine their implications for public financing mechanisms
and program sustainability. Methods Longitudinal, retrospective
study using interrupted time series to analyze: HTN and DM
treatment coverage; total and per capita expenditure; percentage
paid by MoH; and patient cost sharing. Analyzes were conducted
in the dispensing database of the FP program (from 2006 to
2012). Results FP has increased its coverage over time; by
December 2012 FP covered on average 13\% of DM and 11.5\% of HTN
utilization, a growth of over 600 and 1500\%, respectively. The
overall cost per treatment to the MoH declined from R36.43 (R
= reais, the Brazilian currency) to 18.74 for HTN and from
R33.07to R15.05 for DM over the period analyzed, representing
a reduction in per capita cost greater than 50\%. The amount
paid by patients for the medicines covered increased over time
until 2011, but then declined to zero. We estimate that to treat
all patients in need for HTN and DM in 2012 under FP, the
Government would need to expend 97\% of the total medicines
budget. Conclusions FP rapidly increased its coverage in terms
of both program reach and proportion of cost subsidized during
the period analyzed. Costs of individual HTN and DM treatments
in FP were reduced after 2011 for both patients (free) and
government (better negotiated prices). However, overall FP
expenditures by MoH increased due to markedly increased
utilization. The FP is sustainable as a complementary policy but
cannot feasibly substitute for the distribution of medicines by
the SUS.},

be started as soon as hypertension is diagnosed, and medical
practices and health systems must closely monitor patient
progress and system performance. Improvement in hypertension

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Turkey, hypertension was responsible for 13\% of
total deaths in 2015. We apply existing research finding
regarding the impact of a population-wide reduction in sodium
consumption on the decrease of the hypertension prevalence rate
among 15+ years population and the gender-age specific reduction
in total death rates among 30+ years population, and compare
hypertension burden, averted deaths, costs and benefits between
two scenarios. METHODS: The first scenario (i.e. status quo)
assumes constant hypertension prevalence rate and the death
rates between 2015 and 2030. Based on the Framingham Heart Study
and INTERSALT Study findings on the impact of salt-reduction
strategies on hypertension prevalence rate, the second scenario
(Scenario II) assumes a 17\% reduction in the prevalence of
hypertension in Turkey in 2030, from its 2015 prevalence level.
We project hypertension attributable disability adjusted life
years (DALYs) in 2030, monetize DALYs using GDP (and income) per
capita, and compare the projected economic benefits of DALYs
averted and the additional costs associated with the increases
in hypertension treatment through antihypertensive medications
and physician consultations. RESULTS: The estimated benefits of
reducing the economic burden of hypertension deaths outweigh the
cost of providing hypertension treatment. A decrease in
hypertension prevalence by 17\%, attributable to population-wide
reduction in salt consumption, is projected to avert 24.3
thousand deaths in 2030. We projected that, compared to status
quo, 392 thousand DALYs will be averted in Scenario II in 2030.
The economic benefits of reduction in potential hypertension
deaths are estimated to be 6.7 to 8.6 folds higher than the
additional cost of hypertension treatment. CONCLUSION:
Population-wide hypertension prevention and management is a
win-win situation for public health and the Turkish health care
system as the economic benefits of reducing deaths and
disabilities associated with hypertension outweigh the costs

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Since 2011, the Korean government has implemented
differential cost sharing to increase the utilization of primary
care clinics for the management of chronic diseases. The
objective of this study was to examine the impact of the
prescription drug cost-sharing increase on outpatients'
selection of the medical care institution. STUDY DESIGN: This
was a pre-post comparison study. METHODS: Participants were
34,842 patients with hypertension and 13,886 patients with type
2 diabetes, who were all newly prescribed. Data were collected
via national health insurance system claims. The change in the
main medical care institution for disease management before and
after the cost sharing policy was analyzed using logistic
regression analysis. RESULTS: Nearly 18\% of participants with
hypertension and 22\% of participants with diabetes used
tertiary care or general hospital outpatient services before the
policy was implemented. After the increased prescription drug
coinsurance rate (by 10-20\%), the likelihood of selecting
primary care clinics or small hospitals was significantly higher
among patients with hypertension within 1 year (odds ratio [95\%
confidence interval] = 1.29 [1.19-1.41]) than before. However,
the policy effect was not significant among patients with
diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The cost sharing policy was effective in
inducing patients with hypertension to manage their chronic
disease in primary care institutions; however, this was not true
for patients with diabetes. The assurance of high-quality
disease management services and low out-of-pocket expenses may
be needed to encourage patients with chronic diseases to use

Fourth National Family Health Survey evaluated hypertension in a
large population based sample (n = 799,228) and reported
hypertension in 13.8\% men vs. 8.8\% women (overall 11.3\%) aged

years, n = 1,320,555) in Fourth District Level Household Survey
reported hypertension in 25.3\% with greater prevalence in men
(27.4\%) than women (20.0\%). This translates into 207 million
persons (men 112 million, women 95 million) with hypertension in
India. Prevalence would be much higher using 2017 American
guidelines. Global Burden of Diseases study reported that
hypertension led to 1.63 million deaths in India in 2016 as

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertension in low- and middle-income countries,
including Kenya, is of economic importance due to its increasing
prevalence and its potential to present an economic burden to
households. In this study, we examined the patient costs
associated with obtaining care for hypertension in public health
care facilities in Kenya. METHODS: We conducted a
cross-sectional study among adult respondents above 18 years of
age, with at least 6 months of treatment in two counties. A
total of 212 patients seeking hypertension care at five public
facilities were interviewed, and information on care seeking and
the associated costs was obtained. We computed both annual
direct and indirect costs borne by these patients. RESULTS:
Overall, the mean annual direct cost to patients was US\$ 304.8
(95\% CI, 235.7-374.0). Medicines (mean annual cost, US\$ 168.9;
95\% CI, 132.5-205.4), transport (mean annual cost, US\$ 126.7;
95\% CI, 77.6-175.9), and user charges (mean annual cost, US\$
57.7; 95\% CI, 43.7-71.6) were the highest direct cost
categories. Overall mean annual indirect cost was US\$ 171.7
(95\% CI, 152.8-190.5). The incidence of catastrophic health
care costs was 43.3\% (95\% CI, 36.8-50.2) and increased to
59.0\% (95\% CI, 52.2-65.4) when transport costs were included.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive patients incur substantial direct and
indirect costs. High rates of catastrophic costs illustrate the
urgency of improving financial risk protection for these
patients and strengthening primary care to ensure affordability

	abstract = {Several new medications for pulmonary arterial hypertension
(PAH) have recently been introduced; however, current real-world
data regarding US patients with PAH are limited. We conducted a
retrospective administrative claims study to examine PAH
treatment patterns and summarize healthcare utilization and
costs among patients with newly diagnosed PAH treated in US
clinical practice. Patients newly treated for PAH from 1 January
2010 to 31 March 2015 were followed for 12 months. Patient
characteristics, treatment patterns, healthcare resource
utilization, and costs were described. Adherence (proportion of
days covered), persistence (months until therapy
discontinuation/modification), and the probability of continuing
the index regimen were analyzed by index regimen cohort
(monotherapy versus combination therapy). Of 1637 eligible
patients, 93.8\% initiated treatment with monotherapy and 6.2\%
with combination therapy. The most common index regimen was
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE-5I) monotherapy (70.0\%
of patients). A total of 581 patients (35.5\%) modified their
index regimen during the study. Most patients (55.4\%) who began
combination therapy did so on or within six months of the index
date. Endothelin receptor agonists (ERAs) and combination
therapies were associated with higher adherence than PDE-5Is and
monotherapies, respectively. Healthcare utilization was
substantial across the study population, with costs in the
combination therapy cohort more than doubling from baseline to
follow-up. The majority of patients were treated with
monotherapies (most often, PDE-5Is), despite combination
therapies and ERAs being associated with higher medication
adherence. Index regimen adjustments occurred early and in a
substantial proportion of patients, suggesting that inadequate
clinical response to monotherapies may not be uncommon.},

AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness, cross-sectional study. 172
clinical histories of patients with high blood pressure from

management of high blood pressure, but this has positive
repercussions on the control and management of this condition.
High blood pressure figures show controlled management of the

classified into stage 1 and stage 2 and was found to be common in
females (53.42\%) than males (46.57\%). The total costs of stage

observed to be significantly lower (p=0.006) than the cost of

physician fees and laboratory tests were considerably different
however; no variation was seen in cost of transport and loss of
productivity through absenteeism from work. Overall, the present
study indicates that the antihypertensive treatment has imposed a
high burden on the pocket of common man and this is a major
reason for treatment non-adherence. Consequently, it increases
the risks of cardiovascular events, morbidity and mortality.

	title = {What is in your wallet? {A} cluster randomized trial of the effects of showing comparative patient out-of-pocket costs on primary care prescribing for uncomplicated hypertension},
	volume = {13},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug expenditures are responsible for an increasing
proportion of health costs, accounting for \$1.1 trillion in
annual expenditure worldwide. As hundreds of billions of dollars
are being spent each year on overtreatment with prescribed
medications that are either unnecessary or are in excess of
lowest cost-effective therapy, programs are needed that optimize
fiscally appropriate use. We evaluated whether providing
physicians with information on the patient out-of-pocket payment
consequences of prescribing decisions that were in excess of
lowest cost-effective therapy would alter prescribing decisions
using the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension as an exemplar.
METHODS: A single-blind cluster randomized trial was conducted
over a 60-month follow-up period in 76 primary care physicians in
Quebec, Canada, and their patients with uncomplicated
hypertension who were using the MOXXI integrated electronic
health record for drug and health problem management. Physicians
were randomized to an out-of-pocket expenditure module that
provided alerts for comparative out-of-payment costs, thiazide
diuretics as recommended first-line therapy, and tools to monitor
blood pressure targets and medication compliance, or
alternatively the basic MOXXI system. System software and
prescription claims were used to analyze the impact of the
intervention on treatment choice, adherence, and overall and
out-of-pocket payment costs using generalized estimating
equations. RESULTS: Three thousand five-hundred ninety-two
eligible patients with uncomplicated hypertension were enrolled,
of whom 1261 (35.1\%) were newly started (incident patient) on
treatment during follow-up. There was a statistically significant
increase in the prescription of diuretics in the newly treated
intervention (26.6\%) compared to control patients (19.8\%) (RR
1.65, 95\% CI 1.17 to 2.33). For patients already treated
(prevalent patient), there was a statistically significant
interaction between the intervention and patient age, with older
patients being less likely to be switched to a diuretic. Among
the incident patients, physicians with less than 15 years of
experience were much more likely to prescribe a diuretic (OR
10.69; 95\% CI 1.49 to 76.64) than physicians with 15 to 25 years
(OR 0.67; 95\%CI 0.25 to 1.78), or more than 25 years of
experience (OR 1.80; 95\% CI 1.23 to 2.65). There was no
statistically significant effect of the intervention on adherence
or out-of-pocket payment cost. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of
comparative information on patient out-of-pocket payments for
treatment of uncomplicated hypertension had a statistically
significant impact on increasing the initiation of diuretics in
incident patients and switching to diuretics in younger prevalent
patients. The impact of interventions to improve the
cost-effectiveness of prescribing may be enhanced by also
targeting patients with tools to participate in treatment
decision-making and by providing physicians with comparative
out-of-pocket information on all evidence-based alternatives that
would enhance clinical decision-making. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

hypertension have been documented in the U.S., but changes in
medical expenditures associated with hypertension over time have
not been evaluated. This study analyzed these expenditures during
2000-2013 among U.S. adults. METHODS: Data from the Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey were analyzed in 2016. The study
population was non-institutionalized men and non-pregnant women
aged 18 years. Hypertension was defined as ever been
diagnosed with hypertension or currently taking antihypertensive
medications. Medical expenditures included all payments to
medical care providers. Expenditures associated with hypertension
were estimated by two-part regression models and adjusted into
2015 U.S. dollars. Controlling variables included
sociodemographic characteristics, marital status, insurance,
region, smoking status, weight status, health status, and
comorbidities. Trends were analyzed using joinpoint method.
RESULTS: Total per-person annual expenditures associated with
hypertension in 2000-2001 (1,399) were not significantly
different from those in 2012-2013 (1,494) (average annual
percent change [AAPC]= -0.6\%, p=0.794), but annual national
spending increased significantly from 58.7 billion to 109.1
billion (AAPC=8.3\%, p=0.015), mainly because of the increase in
the number of people treated for hypertension. Per-person
outpatient payments were 22.7\% higher in 2012-2013 than in
2000-2001 (416 vs 322, p{\textless}0.05; AAPC=0.8\%, p-trend=0.826).
Payments for prescription medications took up a larger proportion
of the medical expenditures associated with hypertension,
compared to payments for outpatient or other services
(33\%-46\%). CONCLUSIONS: During 2000-2013, annual national
medical expenditures associated with hypertension increased
significantly. Preventing hypertension could alleviate
hypertension-associated economic burden.},

important factor of unsatisfactory blood pressure (BP) control.
This review focuses on therapy-related factors affecting
adherence and suggests how to improve it with a wise choice of
treatment schedule. Complex drug treatment schemes, poor
tolerability and drug substitutions are frequent causes of poor
adherence which, in turn, causes insufficient BP control, greater
incidence of cardiovascular events and, finally, higher global
health costs. The effects of prescribing generic drugs and of
drug substitutions on adherence is also discussed. In terms of
adherence, generic drugs do not seem to be better than branded
drugs, unless patients have to bear very high ``out of pocket''
expenses to buy original drugs, suggesting no advantages in
switching drug with the mere goal of reducing the cost of
therapy. An important role in improving adherence (and thus
cardiovascular events and health expenditure) is also played by
the availability of fixed-dose combinations; among
antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are
those associated with higher levels of adherence and persistence.
Among ARBs, olmesartan stands out for a wide choice of effective
fixed-dose combinations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyse and compare the cost-effectiveness of
different interventions to reduce salt consumption. DESIGN: A
systematic review of published cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA)
and cost-utility analyses (CUA) was undertaken in the databases
EMBASE, MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane and others until July 2016.
Study selection was limited to CEA and CUA conducted in member
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) in English, German or French, without time
limit. Outcomes measures were life years gained (LYG),
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and quality-adjusted life
years (QALY). Relevant aspects in modelling were analysed and
compared. Quality assessments were conducted using the Drummond
and Jefferson/British Medical Journal checklist. SETTING: OECD
member countries. SUBJECTS: Mainly adults. RESULTS: Fourteen CEA
and CUA were included in the review which analysed different
strategies: salt reduction or substitution in processed foods,
taxes, labelling, awareness campaigns and targeted dietary
advice. Fifty-nine out of sixty-two scenarios were cost-saving.
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in international dollars
(Intl.; 2015) was particularly low for taxes, a salt reduction
by food manufacturers and labelling (303 900 Intl./DALY).
However, only six studies analysed cost-effectiveness from a
societal perspective and quality assessments showed flaws in
conducting and a lack of transparency in reporting. CONCLUSIONS:
A population-wide salt reduction could be cost-effective in
prevention of hypertension and CVD in OECD member countries.
However, comparability between study results is limited due to
differences in modelling, applied perspectives and considered
data.},

conditions. Thus, the Korean Government has sought to reduce
general hospital visiting of patients with 52 mild diseases,

2009 and 2011, respectively.We determined whether these

implementing a multi-component, community-based intervention for
hypertension among adults aged {\textgreater} 35 years in a large slum in
Nairobi, Kenya. METHODS: The intervention in 2012-2013 was based
on four components: awareness-raising; improved access to
screening; standardized clinical management of hypertension; and
long-term retention in care. Using multiple sources of data,
including administrative records and surveys, we described the
inputs and outputs of each intervention activity and estimated
the outcomes of each component and the impact of the
intervention. We also estimated the costs associated with
implementation, using a top-down costing approach. FINDINGS: The
intervention reached 60\% of the target population (4049/6780
people), at a cost of 17 United States dollars (US) per person
screened and provided access to treatment for 68\% (660/976) of
people referred, at a cost of US 123 per person with
hypertension who attended the clinic. Of the 660 people who
attended the clinic, 27\% (178) were retained in care, at a cost
of US 194 per person retained; and of those patients, 33\%
(58/178) achieved blood pressure control. The total intervention
cost per patient with blood pressure controlled was US 3205.
CONCLUSION: With moderate implementation costs, it was possible
to achieve hypertension awareness and treatment levels comparable
to those in high-income settings. However, retention in care and
blood pressure control were challenges in this slum setting. For
patients, the costs and lack of time or forgetfulness were
barriers to retention in care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High blood pressure is a leading risk factor for
death and disability in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We evaluated
the costs and cost-effectiveness of hypertension care provided
within the Kwara State Health Insurance (KSHI) program in rural
Nigeria. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the
costs and cost-effectiveness of population-level hypertension
screening and subsequent antihypertensive treatment for the
population at-risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) within the
KSHI program. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted in the KSHI
scenario compared to no access to hypertension care. We used
setting-specific and empirically-collected data to inform the
model. We defined two strategies to assess eligibility for
antihypertensive treatment based on 1) presence of hypertension
grade 1 and 10-year CVD risk of {\textgreater}20\%, or grade 2 hypertension
irrespective of 10-year CVD risk (hypertension and risk based
strategy) and 2) presence of hypertension in combination with a
CVD risk of {\textgreater}20\% (risk based strategy). We generated 95\%
confidence intervals around the primary outcome through
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We conducted one-way
sensitivity analyses across key model parameters and assessed
the sensitivity of our results to the performance of the
reference scenario. RESULTS: Screening and treatment for
hypertension was potentially cost-effective but the results were
sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions with a wide range
of uncertainty. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the
first and second strategy respectively ranged from US 1,406 to
US 7,815 and US 732 to US 2,959 per DALY averted, depending
on the assumptions on risk reduction after treatment and
compared to no access to antihypertensive treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension care within a subsidized private
health insurance program may be cost-effective in rural Nigeria
and public-private partnerships such as the KSHI program may
provide opportunities to finance CVD prevention care in SSA.},

kidney disease, has been common in sub-Saharan Africa for many
years, and rapid urbanization is causing an upsurge of ischaemic
heart disease and metabolic disorders. At least two-thirds of

hypertension) is by far the commonest underlying risk factor for
cardiovascular disease. Its prevention, detection, treatment and
control in sub-Saharan Africa are haphazard and suboptimal. This
is due to a combination of lack of resources and health-care
systems, non-existent effective preventive strategies at a
population level, lack of sustainable drug therapy, and barriers
to complete compliance with prescribed medications. The economic
impact for loss of productive years of life and the need to
divert scarce resources to tertiary care are substantial.},

	abstract = {Background: Hypertension requires life-long medical care, which may cause economic burden and even lead to catastrophic health expenditure. Objective: To estimate the extent of out-of-pocket expenditure for hypertension care at a population level and its impact on households’ budgets in a low-income urban setting in Colombia. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Santa Cruz, a commune in the city of Medellin. In 410 randomly selected households with a hypertensive adult, we estimated annual basic household expenditure and hypertension-attributable out-of-pocket expenditure. For socioeconomic stratification, we categorised households according to basic expenditure quintiles. Catastrophic hypertension-attributable expenditure was defined as out-of-pocket expenditure above 10\% of total household expenditure. Results: The average annual basic household expenditure was US dollars at purchasing power parity (USD-PPP) \$12,255.59. The average annual hypertension-attributable out-of-pocket expenditure was USD-PPP \$147.75 (95\% CI 120.93–174.52). It was incurred by 73.9\% (95\% CI 69.4\%-78.1\%) of patients, and consisted mainly of direct non-medical expenses (76.7\%), predominantly for dietary requirements prescribed as non-pharmacological treatment and for transport to attend health care consultations. Medical out-of-pocket expenditure (23.3\%) was for the most part incurred for pharmacological treatment. Hypertension-attributable out-of-pocket expenditure represented on average 1.6\% (95\% CI 1.3\%-1.9\%) of the total annual basic household expenditure. Eight households (2.0\%; 95\% CI 1.0\%-3.8\%) had catastrophic health expenditure; six of them belonged to the two lowest expenditure quintiles. Payments related to dietary requirements and transport to consultations were critical determinants of their catastrophic expenditure. Conclusions: Out-of-pocket expenditure for hypertension care is moderate on average, but frequent, and mainly made up of direct non-medical expenses. Catastrophic health expenditure is uncommon and affects primarily households in the bottom socioeconomic quintiles. Financial protection should be strengthened by covering the costs of chronic diseases-related dietary requirements and transport to health services in the most deprived households.

The purpose of this study was to assess the use of health services and self-care amongst people with hypertension and to estimate the out-of-pocket expenses associated with such health care use. A sub-study of the 45 and Up Study was conducted amongst 1300 individuals who had earlier reported a clinical diagnosis of hypertension in 2017. A total of 753 (57.9\%) individuals with hypertension returned a completed questionnaire. In the last 12 month, for their hypertension management, 84\% of participants consulted a doctor, 19\% of them consulted an allied health practitioner and 9\% of them consulted a complementary medicine practitioner. The average total out-of-pocket expenditure for hypertension-related health care was Australian \$461.8 per annum, with an estimated Australian \$941 million per annum if extrapolated to all Australians aged 55 years and over with hypertension. Older people with hypertension use a wide range of health services to control their blood pressure including conventional medicine, allied health and complementary medicine practitioners as well as various self-care practices. A substantial amount of out-of-pocket expenditure has been spent on hypertension care annually.

Methods and Results-The study population was derived from the 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Direct and indirect costs were calculated for all-cause healthcare resource utilization. Variables of interest included CVD diagnoses (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, dysrhythmias, or heart failure), ascertained by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification codes, and CRF profile (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, physical activity, and obesity). Two-part econometric models were used to study expenditure data. The final study sample consisted of 15 651 MEPS participants (58.5±12 years, 54\% female). Overall, 5921 (37.8\%) had optimal, 7002 (44.7\%) had average, and 2728 (17.4\%) had poor CRF profile, translating to 54.2, 64.1, and 24.9 million adults in United States, respectively. Significantly lower health expenditures were noted with favorable CRF profile across CVD status. Among study participants with established CVD, overall healthcare expenditures with optimal and average CRF profile were \$5946 and \$3731 less compared with those with poor CRF profile. The respective differences were \$4031 and \$2560 in those without CVD. Conclusions-Favorable CRF profile is associated with significantly lower medical expenditure and healthcare utilization among individuals with and without established CVD.},

In Brazil, the prevalence of SAH is 23.7\%, which caused 203,000 deaths and 3.9 million DALYs in 2015. Objective To estimate the cost of SAH and circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH from the perspective of the Brazilian public health system in 2019. Methods A prevalence-based cost-of-illness was conducted using a top-down approach. The population attributable risk (PAR) was used to estimate the proportion of circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH. The direct medical costs were obtained from official Ministry of Health of Brazil records and literature parameters, including the three levels of care (primary, secondary, and tertiary). Deterministic univariate analyses were also conducted. Results The total cost of SAH and the proportion of circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH was Int\$ 581,135,374.73, varying between Int\$ 501,553,022.21 and Int\$ 776,183,338.06. In terms only of SAH costs at all healthcare levels (Int\$ 493,776,445.89), 97.3\% were incurred in primary care, especially for antihypertensive drugs provided free of charge by the Brazilian public health system (Int\$ 363,888,540.14). Stroke accounted for the highest cost attributable to SAH and the third highest PAR, representing 47\% of the total cost of circulatory diseases attributable to SAH. Prevalence was the parameter that most affected sensitivity analyses, accounting for 36\% of all the cost variation. Conclusion Our results show that the main Brazilian strategy to combat SAH was implemented in primary care, namely access to free antihypertensive drugs and multiprofessional teams, acting jointly to promote care and prevent and control SAH.},

	abstract = {Background: Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and affects nearly one in two adults in the United States when defined as a blood pressure of at least 130/80 mm Hg or on antihypertensive medication (Virani et al., 2021, Circulation, 143, e254). Long-standing disparities in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control among racial and ethnic populations exist in the United States. High-quality evidence exists for how to prevent and control hypertension and for the role nurses can play in this effort. In response to the 2020 Surgeon General's Call to Action to Control Hypertension, nursing leaders from 11 national organizations identified the critical roles and actions of nursing in improving hypertension control and cardiovascular health, focusing on evidence-based nursing interventions and available resources. Aims: To develop a unified “Call to Action for Nurses” to improve control of hypertension and cardiovascular health and provide information and resources to execute this call. Methods: This paper outlines roles that registered nurses, advanced practice nurses, schools of nursing, professional nursing organizations, quality improvement nurses, and nursing researchers can play to control hypertension and prevent CVD in the United States. It describes evidence-based interventions to improve cardiovascular health and outlines actions to bring hypertension and CVD to the forefront as a national priority for nursing. Linking Evidence to Action: Evidence-based interventions exist for nurses to lead efforts to prevent and control hypertension, thus preventing much CVD. Nurses can take actions in their communities, their healthcare setting, and their organization to translate these interventions into real-world practice settings.},

	doi = {10.18553/JMCP.2021.27.12.1680},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertension is highly prevalent in the United States, affecting nearly half of all adults (43\%). Studies have shown that pharmacist-physician collaborative care models (PPCCMs) for hypertension management significantly improve blood pressure (BP) control rates and provide consistent control of BP. Time in target range (TTR) for systolic BP is a novel measure of BP control consistency that is independently associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. There is no evidence that observed improvement in TTR for systolic BP with a PPCCM is cost-effective. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of a PPCCM with usual care for the management of hypertension from the payer perspective. METHODS: We used a decision analytic model with a 3-year time horizon based on published literature and publicly available data. The population consisted of adult patients who had a previous diagnosis of high BP (defined as office-based BP≥140/90 mmHg) or were receiving antihypertensive medications. Effectiveness data were drawn from 2 published studies evaluating the effect of PPCCMs (vs usual care) on TTR for systolic BP and the impact of TTR for systolic BP on 4 cardiovascular outcomes (nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, heart failure [HF], and cardiovascular disease [CVD] death). The model incorporated direct medical costs, including both programmatic costs (ie, direct costs for provider time) and downstream health care utilization associated with acute cardiovascular events. One-way sensitivity and threshold analyses examined model robustness. RESULTS: In base-case analyses, PPCCM hypertension management was associated with lower downstream medical expenditures (difference: −\$162.86) and lower total program costs (difference: −\$108.00) when compared with usual care. PPCCM was associated with lower downstream medical expenditures across all parameter ranges tested in the deterministic sensitivity analysis. For every 10,000 hypertension patients managed with PPCCM vs usual care over a 3-year time horizon, approximately 27 CVD deaths, 29 strokes, 21 nonfatal MIs, and 12 incident HF diagnoses are expected to be averted. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PPCCM compared to usual care on TTR for systolic BP in adults with hypertension. PPCCM was less costly to administer and resulted in downstream health care savings and fewer acute cardiovascular events relative to usual care. Although further research is needed to evaluate the long-term costs and outcomes of PPCCM, payer coverage of PPCCM services may prevent future health care costs and improve patient cardiovascular outcomes.},

	abstract = {Objectives: There is inadequate information on the economic burden of hypertension treatment in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the societal economic burden of hypertension at selected hospitals in Southern Ethiopia. Methods Prevalence-based cost of illness study from a societal perspective was conducted. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were determined by the current WHO's recommended DALY valuation method. Adjustment for comorbidity and a 3\% discount was done for DALYs. The data entry, processing and analysis were done by using SPSS V.21.0 and Microsoft Excel V.2013. Results: We followed a cohort of 406 adult patients with hypertension retrospectively for 10 years from September 2010 to 2020. Two hundred and fifty (61.6\%) of patients were women with a mean age of 55.87±11.03 years. Less than 1 in five 75 (18.5\%) of patients achieved their blood pressure control target. A total of US\$64 837.48 direct cost was incurred due to hypertension. A total of 11 585 years and 579.57 years were lost due to hypertension-related premature mortality and morbidity, respectively. Treated and uncontrolled hypertension accounted for 50.83\% (6027) of total years lost due to premature mortality from treated hypertension cohort. Total productivity loss due to premature mortality and morbidity was US\$449 394.69. The overall economic burden of hypertension was US\$514 232.16 (US\$105.55 per person per month). Conclusion: Societal economic burden of hypertension in Southern Ethiopia was substantial. Indirect costs accounted for more than 8 out of 10 dollars. Treated and uncontrolled hypertension took the lion's share of economic cost and productivity loss due to premature mortality and morbidity. Therefore, designing and implanting strategies for the prevention of hypertension, early screening and detection, and improving the rate of blood pressure control by involving all relevant stakeholders at all levels is critical to saving scarce health resources.},

	abstract = {Background: There is a robust understanding of how specific behavioural, metabolic, and environmental risk factors increase the risk of health burden. However, there is less understanding of how these risks individually and jointly affect health-care spending. The objective of this study was to quantify health-care spending attributable to modifiable risk factors in the USA for 2016. Methods: We extracted estimates of US health-care spending by condition, age, and sex from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Disease Expenditure Study 2016 and merged these estimates with population attributable fraction estimates for 84 modifiable risk factors from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 to produce estimates of spending by condition attributable to these risk factors. Because not all spending can be linked to health burden, we adjusted attributable spending estimates downwards, proportional to the association between health burden and health-care spending across time and age for each aggregate health condition. We propagated underlying uncertainty from the original data sources by randomly pairing the draws from the two studies and completing our analysis 1000 times independently. Findings: In 2016, US health-care spending attributable to modifiable risk factors was US\$730·4 billion (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 694·6–768·5), corresponding to 27·0\% (95\% UI 25·7–28·4) of total health-care spending. Attributable spending was largely due to five risk factors: high body-mass index (\$238·5 billion, 178·2–291·6), high systolic blood pressure (\$179·9 billion, 164·5–196·0), high fasting plasma glucose (\$171·9 billion, 154·8–191·9), dietary risks (\$143·6 billion, 130·3–156·1), and tobacco smoke (\$130·0 billion, 116·8–143·5). Spending attributable to risk factor varied by age and sex, with the fraction of attributable spending largest for those aged 65 years and older (45·5\%, 44·2–46·8). Interpretation: This study shows high spending on health care attributable to modifiable risk factors and highlights the need for preventing and controlling risk exposure. These attributable spending estimates can contribute to informed development and implementation of programmes to reduce risk exposure, their health burden, and health-care cost.

Setting 1088 medical institutions, including general hospitals, traditional Chinese medicine hospitals, special hospitals, basic medical institutions and public health institutions. Participants 180 441 hypertensive outpatients and 14 763 inpatients from 1 January to 31 December 2017. Primary and secondary outcome measures Curative care expenditure for hypertension (CCEht) was measured based on System of Health Accounts 2011. Influenced factors were analysed by univariate analysis and multiple layer perceptron neural network. Results In 2017, CCEht was US\$307.71 million, accounting for 3.63\% of total CCE and 0.14\% of gross domestic product (GDP) in Shanxi Province of China. CCE of hypertensive outpatients (CCEht-out) and inpatients (CCEht-in) accounted for 44.49\% and 55.51\% of CCEht. Drug fee accounted for 81.55\% of CCEht-out and 22.50\% of CCEht-in, respectively. The top three influencing factors were drug fee, surgical fee and hospitalisation days for inpatients, and drug fee, examination fee and test fee for outpatients. Conclusions The medical expenditure of hypertension is still heavy for individuals and society. The diagnosis and treatment capacities of primary healthcare system has been enhanced. New rural cooperation medical insurance and urban employee basic medical insurance have a trend of overusing, and the burden of family healthcare expenditure is still heavy. To ease the economic burden of patients with hypertension and improve the efficiency of social resources utilisation, policymakers should pay more attention to key groups, further increase support for primary healthcare system, standardise the treatment and reimbursement of hypertension and incline the reimbursement policy to outpatient service.},

	abstract = {Objective: Antihypertensives are the most used medication type in the USA, yet there remains uncertainty about the use of different antihypertensives. We sought to characterize use of antihypertensives by and within medication class(es) between 1997 and 2017. Patients and Methods: A repeated cross-sectional study of 493,596 adult individuals using the 1997–2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The Orange Book was used for adjunctive information. The primary outcome was the estimated use by and within antihypertensive medication class(es). Results: The proportion of individuals taking any antihypertensive during a year increased from 1997 to the early 2010s and then remained stable. The proportion of adults using angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) increased during the study period, while angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) increased until 2010 after which rates remained stable. Beta-blocker use was similar to that of ACE-Is with an earlier decline starting in 2012. Thiazide diuretic use increased from 1997 to 2007, leveled off until 2014, and declined from 2015 to 2017. Non-dihydropyridine CCB use declined throughout the study. ACE-Is, ARBs, CCBs, thiazide diuretics, and loop diuretics all had one dominant in-class medication. There was a clear increase in the use of losartan within ARBs, lisinopril within ACE-Is, and amlodipine within CCBs following generic conversion. Furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide started with and maintained a dominant position in their classes. Metoprolol use increased throughout the study and became the dominant beta-blocker. Conclusions: Antihypertensive classes appear to have a propensity to equilibrate to an individual medication, despite a lack of outcomes-based research to compare medications within a class.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Hypertension increases healthcare costs, but the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on these costs is unknown. This study explored the association between healthcare costs and CRF among hypertensive and normotensive men. Methods: We studied 9794 male subjects aged 58.5 ± 11.3 years from the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center, including 6413 with and 3381 without hypertension. CRF was classified into four age-stratified categories according to metabolic equivalents (METs) derived from exercise testing: low fit (4.6 ± 1.2 METs; n = 2481), moderate fit (6.6 ± 1.2 METs; n = 2412), fit (8.0 ± 1.3 METs; n = 2505), and high fit (10.8 ± 2.1 METs; n = 2396). Annual costs per subject were quantified over eight years. Results: Total annual healthcare costs were higher in subjects with hypertension (\$34,794, 95\% CI, 32,828 to 36,761) in comparison to non-hypertensive subjects (\$30,221, 95\% CI, 26,104 to 32,450) (p {\textless} 0.01). In hypertensive subjects, a graded reduction in annual healthcare costs was observed as CRF was higher; costs were \$40,346 for low fit, \$35,939 for moderate fit, \$32,312 for fit, and \$29,277 for high fit subjects (p {\textless} 0.001). For each 1-MET increase in CRF, annual costs per subject (USD) were \$1752 (95\% CI, −2476 to −1,027, p {\textless} 0.001) lower among those with hypertension and \$1025 (95\% CI, −2047 to −2, p {\textless} 0.05) lower in those without hypertension. Conclusions: Higher CRF is associated with lower healthcare costs in men with and without hypertension. The impact of CRF on healthcare costs is more striking in those with hypertension.},

	abstract = {A literature review of peer-reviewed articles published 2000-2019 was conducted to determine the types and extent of hypertension-associated productivity loss among adults in the United States. All monetary outcomes were standardized to 2019 \$ by using the Employment Cost Index. Twenty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria. Nearly half of the articles (12 articles) presented monetary outcomes of productivity loss. Absenteeism (14 articles) and presenteeism (8 articles) were most frequently assessed. Annual absenteeism was estimated to cost more than \$11 billion, nationally controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. The annual additional costs per person were estimated at \$63 for short-term disability, \$72-\$330 for absenteeism, and \$53-\$156 for presenteeism, controlling for participant characteristics; and may be as high as \$2362 for absenteeism and presenteeism when considered in combination. The annual additional time loss per person was estimated as 1.3 days for absenteeism, controlling for common hypertension comorbidities, including stroke and diabetes; and 15.6 days for work and home productivity loss combined, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. The loss from absenteeism alone might be more than 20\% of the total medical expenditure of hypertension. Although the differences in estimation methods and study populations make it challenging to synthesize the costs across the studies, this review provides detailed information on the various types of productivity loss. In addition, the ways in which methods could be standardized for future research are discussed. Accounting for the costs from productivity loss can help public health officials, health insurers, employers, and researchers better understand the economic burden of hypertension.},

Additionally, factors associated with regularity in treatment follow-up were also identified. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken in selected primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare settings between September, 2017 and December, 2018 in Islamabad, Pakistan. A structured data collection form was used to gather sociodemographic and clinical data of recruited patients. Binary logistic regression analyses were undertaken to determine association between regularity in treatment follow-up appointments and blood pressure control and to determine covariates significantly associated with regularity in treatment follow-up appointments. Results: A total of 662 patients with hypertension participated in the study. More than half 346 (52\%) of the patients were females. The mean age of participants was 54 ± 12 years. Only 274 (41\%) patients regularly attended treatment follow-up appointments. Regression analysis found that regular treatment follow-up was an independent predictor of controlled blood pressure (OR 1.561 [95\% CI 1.102–2.211; P = 0.024]). Gender (OR 1.720 [95\% CI 1.259–2.350; P = 0.001]), age (OR 1.462 [CI 95\%:1.059–2.020; P = 0.021]), higher education (OR 1.7 [95\% CI 1.041–2.778; P = 0.034]), entitlement to free medical care (OR 3.166 [95\% CI 2.284–4.388; P = 0.0001]), treatment duration (OR 1.788 [95\% CI 1.288–2.483; P = 0.001]), number of medications (OR 1.585 [95\% CI 1.259–1.996; P = 0.0001]), presence of co-morbidity (OR 3.214 [95\% CI 2.248–4.593; P = 0.0001]) and medication adherence (OR 6.231 [95\% CI 4.264–9.106; P = 0.0001]) were significantly associated with regularity in treatment follow-up appointments. Conclusion: Attendance at follow-up visits was alarmingly low among patients with hypertension in Pakistan which may explain poor treatment outcomes in patients. Evidence-based targeted interventions should be developed and implemented, considering local needs, to improve attendance at treatment follow-up appointments.},

However, the lack of implementation of diet and lifestyle tools into clinical practices and into hospital systems leaves much room for improvement. Obstacles such as poor physician education, financial concerns, patient preference, and social resistance to change have made it difficult to promote healthy lifestyle and nutrition practices throughout all aspects of health systems.

PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were searched for randomized control trials (RCTs) of interventions on lifestyle modifications of hypertensive patients which were performed by healthcare professionals (physician, nurse, pharmacist) and which reported blood pressure measurements. Papers were reviewed by two reviewers and analysed using Cochrane software Revman 5.4. In a meta-analysis difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (BP) was analysed. Results: In total, 34 clinical trials reporting on 22,419 patients (mean age 58.4 years, 49.14\% female, 69.9\% used antihypertensive medications) were included. The mean difference SBP was − 4.41 mmHg (95\% CI, − 5.52to − 3.30) and the mean difference DBP was − 1.66 mmHg (95\% CI − 2.44 to − 0.88) in favor of the intervention group vs usual care. Fifty-six percent of patients achieved BP control in the intervention group vs 44\% in usual care, OR = 1.87 (95\% CI, 1.51 to 2.31). Conclusion: Healthcare professional-led interventions were effective. Patients achieved almost 5 mmHg decrease of SBP and more patients achieved BP control. The results suggest that efforts are needed for widespread implementation.},

Data from 12 904 adults aged 18–95 years, available from the most recent nationally representative 2017–2018 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey were used. Hypertension was defined as having systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, and/or taking anti-hypertensive drugs to control blood pressure. Age-standardized prevalence of hypertension and management were estimated with direct standardisation. A multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression model with a robust variance was used to identify risk factors associated with hypertension and its awareness, treatment, and control. The overall age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 26.2\% (95\% CI, 25.5-26.9); (men: 23.5\%, women: 28.9\%). Among those with hypertension (n = 3531), 36.7\% were aware that they had the condition, and only 31.1\% received anti-hypertensive medication. The prevalence of controlled hypertension was 12.7\% among those with hypertension and 43.6\% among those treated for hypertension (n = 1306). Factors independently associated with hypertension were increasing age, higher body mass index, being women, having diabetes, and residing in selected administrative divisions. A declining trend of hypertension control was observed with increasing age and low education. Hypertension is highly prevalent (one in four) in Bangladeshi adults, while awareness, treatment, and control are low. Irrespective of the risks associated with hypertension and its management, programs to increase its awareness, treatment, and control should be given high priority in reducing hypertension prevalence and improving hypertension control in Bangladesh.},

This study examines the acceptability and cost of a patient-centered, co-created health education intervention with older African Americans living with hypertension. Methods: Twenty women participated in this study that included four weekly, two-hour group sessions centered on hypertension knowledge and calibration of home blood pressure monitors, stress and interpersonal relationship management, sleep and pain management, and healthy eating. The study took place in the Midwest United States. Results: Descriptive statistics were used to analyze acceptability data that included attendance and a brief investigator-generated questionnaire. Twenty women were enrolled. Sixteen participants attended all four sessions, all reported they intended to continue using the intervention and felt it fit within their culture, routine, and self-care practices. The estimated cost of conducting the intervention was \$227.00 (U.S. dollars) per participant. Conclusions: The co-created health education intervention was acceptable. Given the dire need for cost-effective interventions to improve the adoption of health promoting self-care management behavior, to reduce the prevalence of hypertension in African Americans, the results of this study have implications for future research and practice.},

	abstract = {Background - National heart failure (HF) hospitalization rates have not been appropriately age standardized by sex or race/ethnicity. Reporting hospital utilization trends by subgroup is important for monitoring population health and developing interventions to eliminate disparities. Methods and Results - The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to estimate the crude and age-standardized rates of HF hospitalization between 2002 and 2013 by sex and race/ethnicity. Direct standardization was used to age-standardize rates to the 2000 US standard population. Relative differences between subgroups were reported. The national age-adjusted HF hospitalization rate decreased 30.8\% from 526.86 to 364.66 per 100 000 between 2002 and 2013. Although hospitalizations decreased for all subgroups, the ratio of the age-standardized rate for men compared with women increased from 20\% greater to 39\% (P trend=0.002) between 2002 and 2013. Black men had a rate that was 229\% (P trend=0.141) and black women, 240\% (P trend=0.725) with reference to whites in 2013 with no significant change between 2002 and 2013. Hispanic men had a rate that was 32\% greater in 2002 and the difference narrowed to 4\% (P trend=0.047) greater in 2013 relative to whites. For Hispanic women, the rate was 55\% greater in 2002 and narrowed to 8\% greater (P trend=0.004) in 2013 relative to whites. Asian/Pacific Islander men had a 27\% lower rate in 2002 that improved to 43\% (P trend=0.040) lower in 2013 relative to whites. For Asian/Pacific Islander women, the hospitalization rate was 24\% lower in 2002 and improved to 43\% (P trend=0.021) lower in 2013 relative to whites. Conclusions - National HF hospitalization rates have decreased steadily during the recent decade. Disparities in HF burden and hospital utilization by sex and race/ethnicity persist. Significant population health interventions are needed to reduce the HF hospitalization burden among blacks. An evaluation of factors explaining the improvements in the HF hospitalization rates among Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders is needed.},

This study aimed to quantify differences between estimated and practice-detected prevalences of hypertension across English general practices, and to determine how variations in detected prevalence could be explained by population-level and service-level factors. Methods: Descriptive statistics, pair wise correlations between the independent variables and a multivariable regression analysis were undertaken. In the regression model, the outcome was detected hypertension prevalence, adjusted for estimated prevalence, person-related and disease-related determinants of illness and characteristics of general practices. Results: Detected prevalence was substantially lower than estimated prevalence (mean difference 16.23\%; standard deviation 2.88\%). Higher detected prevalence was associated with increased deprivation, increased non-white ethnicity and urban location. Lower detected prevalence was associated with larger list sizes, more general practitioners and being located in the South outside London. The final multivariable model's adjusted R2 value was 0.75. Conclusions: Substantial under-detection of hypertension is widespread across England. Independent of estimated prevalence, factors associated with greater morbidity and population density predicted higher detected prevalence. Identifying patients with undetected hypertension and coordinating care for these patients will require further resources and logistical support in community settings.},

The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). METHODS: The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update. The 2022 Statistical Update is the product of a full year's worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. This year's edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population and an enhanced focus on social determinants of health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, vascular contributions to brain health, and the global burden of cardiovascular disease and healthy life expectancy. RESULTS: Each of the chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics. CONCLUSIONS: The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policymakers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.},

	abstract = {Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide. Owing to the widespread use of antihypertensive medications, global mean blood pressure (BP) has remained constant or has decreased slightly over the past four decades. By contrast, the prevalence of hypertension has increased, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Estimates suggest that 31.1\% of adults (1.39 billion) worldwide had hypertension in 2010. The prevalence of hypertension among adults was higher in LMICs (31.5\%, 1.04 billion people) than in high-income countries (28.5\%, 349 million people). Variations in the levels of risk factors for hypertension, such as high sodium intake, low potassium intake, obesity, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet, may explain some of the regional heterogeneity in hypertension prevalence. Despite the increasing prevalence, the proportions of hypertension awareness, treatment and BP control are low, particularly in LMICs, and few comprehensive assessments of the economic impact of hypertension exist. Future studies are warranted to test implementation strategies for hypertension prevention and control, especially in low-income populations, and to accurately assess the prevalence and financial burden of hypertension worldwide.},

	doi = {10.1109/DFHMC52214.2020.00050},
	abstract = {Background: Multivariate linear regression model is a reliable type of predictive analysis, which perfectly accord with the object of estimating and predicting the economic burden attributable to hypertension. Multivariate linear regression model can estimate how influential covariates are in predicting an explained variable, which variables are significant predictors of the dependent variable, in what way do they impact the outcome variable, and how the following trend will develop. Objectives This study aims to estimate the trend of inpatient and outpatient medical burden attributable to hypertension from 2011 to 2015. Method: Data for this study was from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) 2011, 2013, and 2015, a comprehensive and nationally representative survey of Chinese residents aged 45 and older. The sample sizes in 2011, 2013, and 2015 are respectively 17705, 18605, and 21095. This study uses a set of three multivariate linear regressions to estimate increments of outpatient and inpatient costs. Results: On average, the outpatient cost of medical treatment for hypertension is 9.84 yuan (95\%CI: [3.33yuan, 16.35yuan]) per month. Further statistical evidence reveals that the outpatient costs attributable to HBP in 2013 and 2015 are not significant. The total cost of outpatient service and treatment in 2013 is 22.17 yuan (95\%CI: [12.62yuan, 31.72yuan]), while the number in 2015 accounts for 23.43 yuan (95\% CI [13.57yuan, 33.26 yuan]). Outpatient medical cost attributable to for female is 18.28(95\%CI: [11.73yuan, 24.83yuan]) yuan. The cost of outpatient medical care without public insurance is 15.23 yuan (95\%CI: [1.34yuan, 29.11yuan]). The outpatient medical cost attributable to a high-income level is 20.48 yuan (CI: [12.65-yuan, 28.31 yuan]). The cost of outpatient medical care attribute to the western population was 13.57-yuan (95\% CI: [5.32-yuan, 21.83 yuan]) yuan. Education, marital status and agricultural or nonagricultural workforce are not significant factors for outpatient HBP. The average inpatient medical cost for hypertension is 184.56 yuan (95\% CI: [104.29-yuan, 264.82 yuan]) per year. The total inpatient medical cost in 2013 is 213.92 yuan (95\% CI: [96.16-yuan, 331.68 yuan]). The total inpatient medical cost in 2015 is 268.27 (95\% CI [146.78-yuan, 389.77 yuan]) yuan. Inpatient medical costs attributable to HBP in 2013 and in 2015 are not significant. The inpatient medical cost attributable to non-agriculture population over agriculture population is 259.49 yuan (95\% CI: [155.28-yuan, 363.70 yuan]). Patients who live without a spouse spend 247.67 yuan (95\% CI: [144.38-yuan, 350.96 yuan]). Furthermore, those who are not covered by public insurance on average spend 269.38 yuan (95\% CI: [98.20 yuan, 440.55 yuan]). Inpatient medical cost attributable to a high-income level is 183.08 yuan (95\% CI: [86.59yuan, 279.57yuan]). For those who live in the western part of China, the mean expenditure on hospitalized treatment is 133.11(95\% CI: [31.35yuan, 234.88yuan]). Noticeably, this is the area that is less well-off compared to the metropolises along the eastern coast. Therefore, it can be inferred that education and gender are not significant factors for inpatient HBP. Conclusion: Among the elderly population aged 45 and above in China, the medical expenditure on inpatient and outpatient services of hypertensive patients is significantly higher compared to other age groups. However, the incremental cost of hypertension remained stable while the incremental cost of total medical expenses increased gradually. Thus, HBP may be under control while comorbidities and side effects subsequently increase the medical cost. The sample characteristics chart tells us that HBP is a detection problem rather than treatment problem. Hence, specific demographic groups need to raise awareness of the medical condition.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the use of health services and self-care amongst people with hypertension and to estimate the out-of-pocket expenses associated with such health care use. A sub-study of the 45 and Up Study was conducted amongst 1300 individuals who had earlier reported a clinical diagnosis of hypertension in 2017. A total of 753 (57.9\%) individuals with hypertension returned a completed questionnaire. In the last 12 month, for their hypertension management, 84\% of participants consulted a doctor, 19\% of them consulted an allied health practitioner and 9\% of them consulted a complementary medicine practitioner. The average total out-of-pocket expenditure for hypertension-related health care was Australian \$461.8 per annum, with an estimated Australian \$941 million per annum if extrapolated to all Australians aged 55 years and over with hypertension. Older people with hypertension use a wide range of health services to control their blood pressure including conventional medicine, allied health and complementary medicine practitioners as well as various self-care practices. A substantial amount of out-of-pocket expenditure has been spent on hypertension care annually. Given the global health and economic burden of hypertension, there is an urgent need for more research exploring cost-effective management(s) for hypertensive patients.},

There is a lack of nationally representative data on incidence, causes, and predictors of 30-day readmission after hospitalization for hypertensive emergency. We used the 2013 to 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database to identify index hospitalizations for hypertensive emergency. Primary outcome was all-cause unplanned 30-day readmission. Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of readmission. There were 166 531 index hospitalizations for hypertensive emergency representative of 355 627 (SE, 9401) hospitalizations nationwide in 2013 to 2014. Mean age was 66.0 (SE, 0.14) years, and 53.7\% were women. The overall incidence of unplanned 30-day readmissions was 17.8\%. The most common causes of readmission were heart failure (14.2\%), hypertension with complications (10.2\%), sepsis (5.9\%), acute kidney injury (5.1\%), and cerebrovascular accident (5.1\%). Noncardiovascular causes accounted for 57.9\% of readmissions.

One out of 6 patients hospitalized for hypertensive emergency had an unplanned 30-day readmission. Heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, and stroke were among the most frequent causes of readmission; however, over half of all readmissions were because of noncardiovascular causes.},

	abstract = {The present study used harmonized data from eight studies (N = 28,891) to examine the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and resting systolic blood pressure (SBP). The study replicates and extends our prior work on this topic by examining potential moderation of this association by race and gender. We also examined the extent to which body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and smoking might explain the association between SES and SBP. Data were available from six race/gender groups: 9200 Black women; 2337 Black men; 7248 White women; 6519 White men; 2950 Hispanic women; and 637 Hispanic men. Multivariable regression models showed that greater annual household income was associated with lower SBP in all groups except Hispanic men. The magnitude and form of this negative association differed across groups, with White women showing the strongest linear negative association. Among Black men and Hispanic women, the association was curvilinear: relatively flat among lower income levels, but then negative among higher income ranges. Education also was independently, negatively related to SBP, though evidence was weaker for race and gender differences in the strength of the association. Higher BMI and WC were associated with higher SBP, and current smoking with lower SBP. Inclusion of these risk factors resulted in only a modest change in the magnitude of the SBP and SES relation, accounting on average about 0.4 mmHg of the effect of income and 0.2 mmHg of the effect of education—effects unlikely to be clinically significant. Further understanding of mechanisms underlying the association between SBP and SES may improve risk stratification in clinical settings and potentially inform interventions aimed at reductions in social disparities in health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are worldwide epidemics that inflict burdens on both public health and health care costs. Self-management plays an important role in the proper management of these 3 chronic diseases, and in this context, mobile health (mHealth) can be a cost-effective self-management tool. OBJECTIVE The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of an integrative mHealth approach for obesity, hypertension, and T2DM on body fat, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels and demonstrate the clinical outcomes. The participants were patients aged 40 to 70 years who were treated for T2DM (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] above 6.0\%) without insulin or hypertension and obesity, controlled with pharmacotherapy. METHODS This pilot study was performed using a controlled, randomized, 3-month, 2-period crossover design. A total of 37 participants were recruited from 2 university hospitals in South Korea. Integrative mHealth comprised 4 parts: self-measuring home devices for monitoring blood glucose and blood pressure; 2 smartphone apps, where one gathered lifestyle data, giving them feedback with health information, and the other provided drug information and reminders of the medication schedule; unmanned kiosks for official measurement of blood pressure and body composition; and web-based access to participants' health information. RESULTS Data from the 32 participants were analyzed. Their mean HbA1c level was 7.5\% (SD 0.8, ranging from 6.1\% to 9.4\%). Approximately 38\% (12/32) of the participants had hypertension. BMIs of all participants except 1 were {\textgreater}23 kg/m2. The input rates of food intake and exercise to the smartphone app were very low (24.9\% and 5.3\%, respectively). On the contrary, the input rate of medicine intake was high (84.0\%). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the input rate of taking medicine irrespective of whether the mHealth period was before or after the conventional treatment period (80.3\% and 87.3\%, respectively; P=.06). Among the 3 input functions of food intake, exercise, and medicine intake in smartphone apps, the input of medicine intake was a more helpful, easier to use, and better-designed function than the others. There were no significant differences in changes in body weight (-0.519 kg vs 0 kg), BMI (-0.133 kg/m2 vs -0.167 kg/m2), body composition (body fat -0.255\% vs 0.172\%), blood pressure (systolic -0.226 mm Hg vs -2.839 mm Hg), and HbA1c (-0.269\% vs -0.009\%) between the integrative mHealth and conventional treatment groups. However, in proportion to the elevation in the input rate of taking medicine, body fat mass (P=.04) and HbA1c (P=.03) were lower in the integrative mHealth group. CONCLUSIONS Although smartphone apps can influence body fat and blood glucose levels, they have failed to show clinical improvement. A higher input rate of taking medicine was related to significantly lower body fat mass and HbA1c levels.},

	abstract = {Background: To analyze the risk factors for hypertension in different age groups of urban and rural residents in Tianjin. Methods: A total of 33,997 people (35–75 years old) from 13 community health service centers and primary hospitals in Tianjin participated in this study. They were divided into the youth group (≤ 40 years old), middle-aged group (41–65 years old), and elderly group ({\textgreater} 65 years old). Then, a questionnaire survey was administered, followed by physical and blood biochemical examinations. The demographic characteristics and prevalence were recorded and counted. Subsequently, risk factors were analyzed using univariate and stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: In the youth, middle-aged, and elderly groups, the prevalence rate of hypertension was 18.65, 51.80, and 76.61\%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that obesity(OR: 3.263, 95\% CI: 1.039–1.656), men (OR: 2.117, 95\% CI: 1.691–2.651), diabetes (OR: 1.978, 95\% CI: 1.398–2.799), high triglycerides(OR 1.968 95\% CI: 1.590–2.434) and family history of stroke (OR: 1.936, 95\% CI: 1.287–2.911) are the five factors in youth. In middle-aged group, the significantly associating factors were obesity (OR: 2.478, 95\% CI: 2.330–2.636), diabetes (OR: 2.173, 95\% CI: 1.398–2.799), family history of stroke (OR: 1.808, 95\% CI: 1.619–2.020), maleness (OR: 1.507, 95\% CI: 1.412–1.609),Hypertriglyceridemia (OR 1.490 95\% CI: 1.409–1.577),family history of cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.484, 95\% CI: 1.307–1.684),Hypercholesterolemia (OR 1.228 95\% CI: 1.160–1.299). In the elderly group, obesity (OR: 2.104, 95\% CI: 1.830–2.418), family history of strokes (OR: 1.688, 95\% CI: 1.243–2.292), diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.544, 95\% CI: 1.345–1.773), family history of cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.470, 95\% CI: 1.061–2.036), hypertriglyceridemia (OR: 1.348, 95\% CI: 1.192–1.524) increased the risk for hypertension. Waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) increased with age, and the value of these two measures for predicting hypertension was better than BMI in middle-aged group. Conclusion: Obesity is the most important risk factor for hypertension in all age groups. Diabetes, family history of strokes and high triglyceride were also significant risk factors for all age groups. There was a gender difference between the young and middle-aged groups, with men more likely to hypertension. Waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were better predictors of hypertension than BMI in middle-aged group.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: The aim of the paper is to test the influence of social status and psychological well-being (independent variables) on hypertensive condition (dependent variable), when adjusting for traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease (control variables). The analysis is based on data collected from SEPHAR III, a nationally representative epidemiologic study of the Romanian adult population. Recent Findings: Understanding the social roots of health issues is of considerable importance in developing effective strategies and policies. In this context, most studies explain the influence of social and psychological indicators on hypertension by considering the mediating effects of class-based lifestyle practices, i.e., the full range of economic, social, or symbolic resources available to particular social classes. However, the effect of traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease in shaping the relationship between psychosocial status and hypertension has remained mostly unexplored. Summary: The influence of socioeconomic status and psychological well-being on hypertensive condition is assimilated by age as a variable with both biological and social foundations. Age appears not only as a risk factor for high blood pressure but also as an emergent component of psychosocial status. Furthermore, people without higher education are more likely to be known hypertensives with uncontrolled blood pressure values. Social and economic vulnerabilities (e.g., age, education) are interrelated with several health conditions, which support the necessity to develop and implement integrated public policies based on interventions coordinated across several domains. Moreover, social and psychological determinants that predispose to certain health risks should be considered in medical practice.},

	abstract = {Background: Inadequate diagnosis and suboptimal control of hypertension is a major driver of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in Africa. Understanding the levels of awareness, treatment and control of hypertension and the associated factors has important implications for hypertension control efforts.Methods: The PubMed database was searched for original articles related to awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in Africa published between 1993 and 2013. The key search terms were: Africa, awareness, treatment, control, and hypertension. Exploration of bibliographies cited in the identified articles was done to provide further studies. Full texts of the articles were obtained from various internet sources and individual authors. A data extraction sheet was used to collect this information.Results: Thirty eight studies drawn from 23 African countries from all regions of the continent met the inclusion criteria. The levels of awareness, treatment and control varied widely from country to country. Rural populations had lower levels of awareness than urban areas. North African countries had the highest levels of treatment in the continent. There was generally poor control of hypertension across the region even among subjects that were aware of their status and those that were treated. On the whole, the women had a better control status than the men.Conclusion: There are low levels of awareness and treatment of hypertension and even lower levels of control. Tailored research is required to uncover specific reasons behind these low levels of awareness and treatment, and especially control, in order to inform policy formulation for the improvement of outcomes of hypertensive patients in Africa. © 2013 Kayima et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The prevalence of hypertension continues to rise in low- and middle-income- countries (LMICs) where scalable, evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that are designed to reduce morbidity and mortality attributed to hypertension have yet to be fully adopted or disseminated. We sought to evaluate evidence from published randomized controlled trials using EBIs for hypertension control implemented in LMICs, and identify the WHO/ExpandNet scale-up components that are relevant for consideration during "scale-up" implementation planning. METHODS Systematic review of RCTs reporting EBIs for hypertension control implemented in LMICs that stated "scale-up" or a variation of scale-up; using the following data sources PubMed/Medline, Web of Science Biosis Citation Index (BCI), CINAHL, EMBASE, Global Health, Google Scholar, PsycINFO; the grey literature and clinicaltrials.gov from inception through June 2021 without any restrictions on publication date. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, conducted data extraction using the WHO/ExpandNet Scale-up components as a guide and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We provide intervention characteristics for each EBI, BP results, and other relevant scale-up descriptions. MAIN RESULTS Thirty-one RCTs were identified and reviewed. Studies reported clinically significant differences in BP, with 23 studies reporting statistically significant mean differences in BP (p {\textless} .05) following implementation. Only six studies provided descriptions that captured all of the nine WHO/ExpandNet components. Multi-component interventions, including drug therapy and health education, provided the most benefit to participants. The studies were yet to be scaled and we observed limited reporting on translation of the interventions into existing institutional policy (n = 11), cost-effectiveness analyses (n = 2), and sustainability measurements (n = 3). CONCLUSION This study highlights the limited data on intervention scalability for hypertension control in LMICs and demonstrates the need for better scale-up metrics and processes for this setting.

	abstract = {Objectives: Hypertension is a major burden among African migrants, but the extent of the differences in prevalence, treatment, and control among similar African migrants and nonmigrants living in different contexts in high-income countries and rural and urban Africa has not yet been assessed. We assessed differences in hypertension prevalence and its management among relatively homogenous African migrants (Ghanaians) living in three European cities (Amsterdam, London, and Berlin) and nonmigrants living in rural and urban Ghana. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted among Ghanaian adults (n=5659) aged 25-70 years. Comparisons between sites were made using prevalence ratios with adjustment for age, education, and BMI. Results: The age-standardised prevalence of hypertension was 22 and 28\% in rural Ghanaian men and women. The prevalence was higher in urban Ghana [men, 34\%; adjusted prevalence ratio=1.37, 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.70]; and much higher in migrants in Europe, especially in Berlin (men, 57\%; prevalence ratio=2.21, 1.78-2.73; women, 51\%; prevalence ratio=1.74, 1.45-2.09) than in rural Ghana. Hypertension awareness and treatment levels were higher in Ghanaian migrants than in nonmigrant Ghanaians. However, adequate hypertension control was lower in Ghanaian migrant men in Berlin (20\%; prevalence ratio=0.43 95\%, 0.23-0.82), Amsterdam (29\%; prevalence ratio=0.59, 0.35-0.99), and London (36\%; prevalence ratio=0.86, 0.49-1.51) than rural Ghanaians (59\%). Among women, no differences in hypertension control were observed. About 50\% of migrants to 85\% of rural Ghanaians with severe hypertension (Blood pressure{\textgreater}180/110) were untreated. Antihypertensive medication prescription patterns varied considerably by site. Conclusion: Hypertension prevalence, awareness, and treatment levels were generally higher in African migrants, but blood pressure control level was lower in Ghanaian migrant men compared with their nonmigrant peers.

Methods: We used the Nouna Health District Household Survey to collect data on 800 households during 2000-01 for our analysis. The determinants of household catastrophic expenditure were identified by multivariate logistic regression method. Findings: Even at very low levels of health care utilization and modest amount of health expenditure, 6-15\% of total households in Nouna District incurred catastrophic health expenditure. The key determinants of catastrophic health expenditure were economic status, household health care utilization especially for modern medical care, illness episodes in an adult household member and presence of a member with chronic illness. Conclusion: We conclude that the poorest members of the community incurred catastrophic health expenses. Setting only one threshold/cut-off value to determine catastrophic health expenses may result in inaccurate estimation leading to misinterpretation of important factors. Our findings have important policy implications and can be used to ensure better access to health services and a higher degree of financial protection for low-income groups against the economic impact of illness.},

Objective: To assess urban and rural differences in blood pressure (BP) and hypertension, and to determine factors associated with BP in this sub-Saharan Africa population. Study design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Ashanti region of Ghana, West Africa. Participants: There were 1431 participants (644 males and 787 females). Of these, 578 were from the rural setting (237 males and 341 females) and 853 from the urban setting (407 males and 446 females). Results: Age-adjusted mean systolic and diastolic BP levels were lower in rural men than in urban men (129/75 versus 133/78, P{\textless}0.001). The mean systolic and diastolic BP levels were also lower in rural women than in urban women (126/76 versus 131/80, P{\textless}0.001). After adjustments for age, the odds ratios (95\% CI) for being hypertensive were 1.9 (1.3-2.9; P{\textless}0.01) for urban men and 1.9 (1.3-2.8; P{\textless}0.0001) for urban women. Urban women were more likely than rural women to be aware of their hypertensive condition (odds ratio 2.3, 95\% CI, 1.2-4.2; P{\textless}0.001). Treatment and control of hypertension did not differ between the groups in either men or women. In multiple linear regression analysis, age, urban dwelling, BMI and heart rate were independently associated with systolic and diastolic BP in both men and women. Smoking and alcohol consumption were independently associated with systolic and diastolic BP but only in men. Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrate that high BP (hypertension) is an important public health burden in both urban and rural settings in this sub-Saharan African population. Cost-effective public health measures are urgently needed to prevent high BP from becoming another public health burden. © 2006 The Royal Institute of Public Health.},

	abstract = {Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in Ghana. This study examines the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension among Ghanaian aged 15–49 years. This cross-sectional study retrieved data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS). The sample, comprising of 13,247 respondents aged 15–49 years, was analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-Square tests, independent sample t-tests and binary logistic regressions. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 13.0\% (12.1\% for males and 13.4\% for females). Among respondents who had hypertension, 45.6\% were aware of their hypertension status; 40.5\% were treating the condition while 23.8\% had their blood pressure controlled (BP {\textless}140/90 mmHg). Socio-economic and demographic factors, health insurance coverage and recent visit to health facilities played significant roles in hypertension prevalence and awareness. While region of residence and health facility visits were predictors of hypertension treatment, age and region of residence predicted hypertension control in this population. This study suggests that in order to address the increasing burden of hypertension in Ghana, there should be an expansion of the National Health Insurance Scheme and development of measures to reduce health inequities. Also, some of the determining factors such as age, gender, marital status are similar to other cultures; therefore, existing interventions from those cultures could be adapted in addressing hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment and control in Ghana.},

Because some of the risk factors for stroke are modifiable, characterisation of these risk factors in the Ghanaian population as well as outcomes of stroke are urgently needed to guide policy for non-communicable diseases. We therefore conducted this study to evaluate the frequencies of the traditional risk factors and outcomes of stroke at the main tertiary referral centre in the middle belt of Ghana in a prospective observational study.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke were consecutively recruited and vascular risk factors were assessed as well as markers of severity of stroke and in-patient treatment outcomes. 265 patients were recruited, 56.6\% were females and mean ± SD age of 64.6 ± 14.54 years. 85\%, 73\% and 58\% of patients had systemic arterial hypertension, physical inactivity and obesity respectively as common risk factors. We identified that patients with stroke had a median of 3 traditional risk factors, were unaware of the presence of these risk factors or were poorly controlled if known. Stroke was associated with a high in-patient case fatality rate of 43\% principally among patients with haemorrhagic stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that urgent concerted efforts are required to improve public awareness and management of the prevailing risk factors of stroke in Ghana.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries are currently experiencing one of the most rapid epidemiological transitions characterized by increasing urbanization and changing lifestyle factors. This has resulted in an increase in the incidence of non-communicable diseases, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD). This double burden of communicable and chronic non-communicable diseases has long-term public health impact as it undermines healthcare systems. PURPOSE The purpose of this paper is to explore the socio-cultural context of CVD risk prevention and treatment in sub-Saharan Africa. We discuss risk factors specific to the SSA context, including poverty, urbanization, developing healthcare systems, traditional healing, lifestyle and socio-cultural factors. METHODOLOGY We conducted a search on African Journals On-Line, Medline, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases using combinations of the key country/geographic terms, disease and risk factor specific terms such as "diabetes and Congo" and "hypertension and Nigeria". Research articles on clinical trials were excluded from this overview. Contrarily, articles that reported prevalence and incidence data on CVD risk and/or articles that report on CVD risk-related beliefs and behaviors were included. Both qualitative and quantitative articles were included. RESULTS The epidemic of CVD in SSA is driven by multiple factors working collectively. Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise and smoking contribute to the increasing rates of CVD in SSA. Some lifestyle factors are considered gendered in that some are salient for women and others for men. For instance, obesity is a predominant risk factor for women compared to men, but smoking still remains mostly a risk factor for men. Additionally, structural and system level issues such as lack of infrastructure for healthcare, urbanization, poverty and lack of government programs also drive this epidemic and hampers proper prevention, surveillance and treatment efforts. CONCLUSION Using an African-centered cultural framework, the PEN3 model, we explore future directions and efforts to address the epidemic of CVD risk in SSA.},

In this paper we discuss the impact of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) on primary healthcare services in urban poor communities in Accra, Ghana. Methods. We review the evidence on the evolution of universal health coverage in Ghana and the central role of the community-based health planning services (CHPS) programme and the National Health Insurance Scheme in primary health care. We present preliminary findings from a study on community CVD knowledge, experiences, responses and access to services. Results: The rising burden of NCDs in Ghana will affect the achievement of universal health coverage, particularly in urban areas. There is a significant unmet need for CVD care in the study communities. The provision of primary healthcare services for CVD is not accessible, equitable or responsive to the needs of target communities.

The choice of financing method should mobilize resources for health care and provide financial protection. This review systematically assesses the evidence of the extent to which community-based health insurance is a viable option for low-income countries in mobilizing resources and providing financial protection. The review contributes to the literature on health financing by extending and qualifying existing knowledge. Overall, the evidence base is limited in scope and questionable in quality. There is strong evidence that community-based health insurance provides some financial protection by reducing out-of-pocket spending. There is evidence of moderate strength that such schemes improve cost-recovery. There is weak or no evidence that schemes have an effect on the quality of care or the efficiency with which care is produced. In absolute terms, the effects are small and schemes serve only a limited section of the population. The main policy implication of the review is that these types of community financing arrangements are, at best, complementary to other more effective systems of health financing. To improve reliability and validity of the evidence base, analysts should agree on a more coherent set of outcome indicators and a more consistent assessment of these indicators. Policy makers need to be better informed as to both the costs and the benefits of implementing various financing options. The current evidence base on community-based health insurance is mute on this point.},

	abstract = {Background: In 2004, Ghana implemented a national health insurance scheme (NHIS) as a step towards achieving universal health coverage. In this paper, we assessed the level of enrollment and factors associated with NHIS membership in two predominantly rural districts of northern Ghana after eight years of implementation, with focus on the poor and vulnerable populations. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from July 2012 to December 2012 among 11,175 randomly sampled households with their heads as respondents. Information on NHIS status, category of membership and socio-demographic characteristics of household members was obtained using a structured questionnaire. Principal component analysis was used to compute wealth index from household assets as estimates of socio-economic status (SES). The factors associated with NHIS enrollment were assessed using logistic regression models. The reasons behind enrollment decisions of each household member were further investigated against their SES. Results: Approximately half of the sampled population of 39,262 were registered with a valid NHIS card; 53.2\% of these were through voluntary subscriptions by payment of premium whilst the remaining (46.8\%) comprising of children below the ages of 18 years, elderly 70 years and above, pregnant women and formal sector workers were exempt from premium payment. Despite an exemption policy to ameliorate the poor and vulnerable households against catastrophic health care expenditures, only 0.5\% of NHIS membership representing 1.2\% of total exemptions granted on accounts of poverty and other social vulnerabilities was applied for the poor. Yet, cost of premium was the main barrier to NHIS registration (92.6\%) and non-renewal (78.8\%), with members of the lowest SES being worst affected. Children below the ages of 18 years, females, urban residents and those with higher education and SES were significantly more likely to be enrolled with the scheme. Conclusions: Despite the introduction of policy exemptions as an equity measure, the poorest of the poor were rarely identified for exemption. The government must urgently resource the Department of Social Welfare to identify the poor for NHIS enrollment.},

The aim of the scheme was to reduce the cost of healthcare provision and increase access to healthcare. This paper investigates the effect of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) on healthcare utilization and out-of-pocket payment, from the providers’ perspective. The study uses data from the seventh round of the Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS 7) conducted in 2016/2017 and employs the estimation method of Propensity Score Matching (PSM). The findings are that enrollment onto Ghana’s National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) increases healthcare utilization by 26\% and decreases out-of-pocket payment by 4\%. However, about 48\% of the population are still not enrolled, citing various reasons. Even those who enrolled, about 30\% had dropped out for several reasons. The study identifies age, income, education, sex, and location of residence as the main determinants of enrolling onto the NHIS. I show that the National Health Insurance Scheme increases healthcare utilization and reduces out-of-pocket payment in Ghana. A number of Ghanaians have either not registered or registered but have stopped enrolling citing no money, no need for NHIS, and no confidence in the system’ as reasons. Any policy to invigorate the public confidence in NHIS and increases enrollment should be targeted at the young, poor, less educated, males, and rural dwellers.},

	abstract = {Introduction: many hypertensive patients require two or more anti-hypertensive drugs, but in low-and middle-income countries there may be challenges with medication access or affordability. The objective of this study was to determine accessibility and affordability of anti-hypertensive medicines and their association with blood pressure (BP) control among hypertensive patients attending the Korle-Bu teaching hospital (KBTH) polyclinic. Methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted among 310 systematically sampled hypertensive patients attending the KBTH Polyclinic in Ghana. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain data on patient demographics and clinical characteristics, prices, availability and mode of payment of generic anti-hypertensive medicines. Results: fifty-nine patients (19.4\%) made out-of-pocket payments. At the private pharmacy and hospital, 123 (40.5\%) and 77 patients (25.3\%) respectively could not afford four anti-hypertensive medicines. Medicines availability at KBTH was 60\%. Continuous access to BP drugs at KBTH was 14.8\%. Overall access was 74.9\% (SD ± 41.3). Out-of-pocket affordability of the medicines was positively correlated with BP control (R=0.12, p=0.037). Obtaining medicines via health insurance only was more likely to result in BP control than making any out-of-pocket payments (OR= 2.185; 95\% CI, 1.215-3.927). Access at KBTH was more likely to result in BP control (OR=1.642; 95\% C.I, 0.843-3.201). Conclusion: there were access challenges although most patients obtained BP medication free. Out-of-pocket affordability is a challenge for some hypertensive patients. Access to affordable BP medication can improve BP control. These findings provide an impetus for urgently evaluating access to affordable anti-hypertensive medicines in other hospitals in Ghana.},

	abstract = {Background: The government of Ghana introduced the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2004 with the goal of achieving universal coverage within 5 years. Evidence, however, shows that expanding NHIS coverage and especially retaining members have remained a challenge. A multilevel perspective was employed as a conceptual framework and methodological tool to examine why enrolment and retention in the NHIS remains low. Methods: A household survey was conducted after 20 months educational and promotional activities aimed at improving enrolment and retention rates in 15 communities in the Central and Eastern Regions (ERs) of Ghana. Observation, in-depth interviews and informal conversations were used to collect qualitative data. Forty key informants (community members, health providers and district health insurance schemes’ [DHISs] staff) purposely selected from two case-study communities in the Central Region (CR) were interviewed. Several community members, health providers and DHISs’ staff were also engaged in informal conversations in the other five communities in the region. Also, four staff of the Ministry of Health (MoH), Ghana Health Service (GHS) and National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) were engaged in in-depth interviews. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse quantitative data. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic content analysis. Results: The results show that factors that influence enrolment and retention in the NHIS are multi-dimensional and cut across all stakeholders. People enrolled and renewed their membership because of NHIS’ benefits and health providers’ positive behaviour. Barriers to enrolment and retention included: poverty, traditional risk-sharing arrangements influence people to enrol or renew their membership only when they need healthcare, dissatisfaction about health providers’ behaviour and service delivery challenges. Conclusion: Given the multi-dimensional nature of barriers to enrolment and retention, we suggest that the NHIA should engage DHISs, health providers and other stakeholders to develop and implement intervention activities to eliminate corruption, shortage of drugs in health facilities and enforce the compulsory enrolment stated in the NHIS policy to move the scheme towards universal coverage.},

	abstract = {Background: Access to health insurance is expected to have positive effect in improving access to healthcare and offer financial risk protection to households. Ghana began the implementation of a National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2004 as a way to ensure equitable access to basic healthcare for all residents. After a decade of its implementation, national coverage is just about 34\% of the national population. Affordability of the NHIS contribution is often cited by households as a major barrier to enrolment in the NHIS without any rigorous analysis of this claim. In light of the global interest in achieving universal health insurance coverage, this study seeks to examine the extent to which affordability of the NHIS contribution is a barrier to full insurance for households and a burden on their resources. Methods: The study uses data from a cross-sectional household survey involving 2,430 households from three districts in Ghana conducted between January-April, 2011. Affordability of the NHIS contribution is analysed using the household budget-based approach based on the normative definition of affordability. The burden of the NHIS contributions to households is assessed by relating the expected annual NHIS contribution to household non-food expenditure and total consumption expenditure. Households which cannot afford full insurance were identified. Results: Results show that 66\% of uninsured households and 70\% of partially insured households could afford full insurance for their members. Enroling all household members in the NHIS would account for 5.9\% of household non-food expenditure or 2.0\% of total expenditure but higher for households in the first (11.4\%) and second (7.0\%) socio-economic quintiles. All the households (29\%) identified as unable to afford full insurance were in the two lower socio-economic quintiles and had large household sizes. Non-financial factors relating to attributes of the insurer and health system problems also affect enrolment in the NHIS. Conclusion: Affordability of full insurance would be a burden on households with low socio-economic status and large household size. Innovative measures are needed to encourage abled households to enrol. Policy should aim at abolishing the registration fee for children, pricing insurance according to socio-economic status of households and addressing the inimical non-financial factors to increase NHIS coverage.},

Methods: Methods included analysis of routine data, focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and administration of a structured questionnaire. Results: Providers modified exemptions policy implementation arrangements, sometimes giving partial or no exemptions. Clients who knew or suspected exemption entitlements failed to request them because of fear of negative reactions from providers. Providers attributed their modification of implementation arrangements and negative reactions to the threat posed to the financial viability of their institutions by reimbursement uncertainty and delays. At the time of the study insurance coverage was low and frontline workers were not noticeably modifying implementation arrangements. However, the underlying goal conflicts, resource scarcity, conditions of work and relationships between frontline workers and clients that fueled the exemptions policy implementation gaps were unchanged. The potential for the health insurance policy to stumble over implementation gaps as happened with the exemptions policy therefore remained. Conclusions: Policies that do not take into account the incentives for frontline worker adherence and align them better with policy objectives may experience implementation gaps. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Since Bitcoin's success, there has been a greater emphasis on researching the use of blockchain in a wide range of applications, such as agriculture, education, government, voting systems, etc. This generation of Blockchain applications is termed blockchain 3.0. Blockchain technology provides enhanced security, auditability, privacy, accountability, and many more features over a centralized system. Fraud in insurance is an international problem affecting all insurance subdomains in both developed and developing countries. Fraud, corruption, and many other data-related problems are threatening the financial security of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana and if not attended to, the core aims of the scheme to provide universal healthcare services will not be realized. Consequently, the objective of this work is to design and implement a blockchain-based solution to protect the NHIS from plummeting financially. This paper presents the conceptual view of the proposed system, sequence and use case diagrams, data management framework, smart notification system, and smart claim processing system. The system was evaluated using the DeLone \& McLean Information Systems Success Model. It was used to validate the behavioural aspect of the system. The study discovered a significant influence of information quality and user satisfaction. On the contrary, system quality seems to have an almost significant influence on the use and user satisfaction of the proposed system.},

	abstract = {Objectives To assess the prevalence and predictors of non-adherence to clinic appointments in adult patients with poorly controlled hypertension. Design A descriptive cross-sectional study. Setting A primary care setting (family medicine clinic) overseen by family physicians in Kano, Nigeria. Participants Two hundred and thirty-four randomly selected patients, aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of hypertension, who had been on treatment for ≥1 year and had a current blood pressure of ≥140/90 mmHg were included. Main outcome measures Non-adherence to clinic appointment among participants. Results Participants' mean age was 55±12.2 years (range: 23-85 years); they were predominantly females (163, 69.7\%). Sixty (25.6\%) participants were non-adherent to clinic-appointments. Being employed (OR [Odds ratio] =2.92, 95\%CI [confident interval] =1.52-5.65, P=0.002), inability of participants or their children to pay the medical bills (OR=2.92,95\%CI=1.42-6.00, P=0.004), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of {\textless}160mmHg (OR=0.43, 95\%CI=0.22-0.86, P=0.018) were predictors of clinic appointment non-adherence. Conclusions The prevalence of non-adherence to clinic appointments was high. Being employed, patients or their children's inability to pay medical bills, and higher SBP were predictors of non-adherence to clinic appointments. Therefore, more studies are needed on effective interventions to reduce non-adherence to clinic appointments in this setting.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent the highest burden of disease globally. Medicines are a critical intervention used to prevent and treat CVD. This review describes access to medication for CVD from a health system perspective and strategies that have been used to promote access, including providing medicines at lower cost, improving medication supply, ensuring medicine quality, promoting appropriate use, and managing intellectual property issues. Using key evidence in published and gray literature and systematic reviews, we summarize advances in access to cardiovascular medicines using the 5 health system dimensions of access: availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality of medicines. There are multiple barriers to access of CVD medicines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Low availability of CVD medicines has been reported in public and private healthcare facilities. When patients lack insurance and pay out of pocket to purchase medicines, medicines can be unaffordable. Accessibility and acceptability are low for medicines used in secondary prevention; increasing use is positively related to country income. Fixed-dose combinations have shown a positive effect on adherence and intermediate outcome measures such as blood pressure and cholesterol. We have a new opportunity to improve access to CVD medicines by using strategies such as efficient procurement of low-cost, quality-assured generic medicines, development of fixed-dose combination medicines, and promotion of adherence through insurance schemes that waive copayment for long-term medications. Monitoring progress at all levels, institutional, regional, national, and international, is vital to identifying gaps in access and implementing adequate policies.},

	abstract = {Background Several international guidelines recommend the consumption of two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day, but their intake is thought to be low worldwide. We aimed to determine the extent to which such low intake is related to availability and affordability. Methods We assessed fruit and vegetable consumption using data from country-specific, validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, which enrolled participants from communities in 18 countries between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2013. We documented household income data from participants in these communities; we also recorded the diversity and non-sale prices of fruits and vegetables from grocery stores and market places between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2013. We determined the cost of fruits and vegetables relative to income per household member. Linear random effects models, adjusting for the clustering of households within communities, were used to assess mean fruit and vegetable intake by their relative cost. Findings Of 143 305 participants who reported plausible energy intake in the food frequency questionnaire, mean fruit and vegetable intake was 3·76 servings (95\% CI 3·66–3·86) per day. Mean daily consumption was 2·14 servings (1·93–2·36) in low-income countries (LICs), 3·17 servings (2·99–3·35) in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), 4·31 servings (4·09–4·53) in upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), and 5·42 servings (5·13–5·71) in high-income countries (HICs). In 130 402 participants who had household income data available, the cost of two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day per individual accounted for 51·97\% (95\% CI 46·06–57·88) of household income in LICs, 18·10\% (14·53–21·68) in LMICs, 15·87\% (11·51–20·23) in UMICs, and 1·85\% (−3·90 to 7·59) in HICs (ptrend=0·0001). In all regions, a higher percentage of income to meet the guidelines was required in rural areas than in urban areas (p{\textless}0·0001 for each pairwise comparison). Fruit and vegetable consumption among individuals decreased as the relative cost increased (ptrend=0·00040). Interpretation The consumption of fruit and vegetables is low worldwide, particularly in LICs, and this is associated with low affordability. Policies worldwide should enhance the availability and affordability of fruits and vegetables.

	abstract = {Background Hypertension is considered the most important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, but its control is poor worldwide. We aimed to assess the availability and affordability of blood pressure-lowering medicines, and the association with use of these medicines and blood pressure control in countries at varying levels of economic development. Methods We analysed the availability, costs, and affordability of blood pressure-lowering medicines with data recorded from 626 communities in 20 countries participating in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study. Medicines were considered available if they were present in the local pharmacy when surveyed, and affordable if their combined cost was less than 20\% of the households' capacity to pay. We related information about availability and affordability to use of these medicines and blood pressure control with multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models, and compared results for high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income countries. Data for India are presented separately because it has a large generic pharmaceutical industry and a higher availability of medicines than other countries at the same economic level. Findings The availability of two or more classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs was lower in low-income and middle-income countries (except for India) than in high-income countries. The proportion of communities with four drug classes available was 94\% in high-income countries (108 of 115 communities), 76\% in India (68 of 90), 71\% in upper-middle-income countries (90 of 126), 47\% in lower-middle-income countries (107 of 227), and 13\% in low-income countries (nine of 68). The proportion of households unable to afford two blood pressure-lowering medicines was 31\% in low-income countries (1069 of 3479 households), 9\% in middle-income countries (5602 of 65 471), and less than 1\% in high-income countries (44 of 10 880). Participants with known hypertension in communities that had all four drug classes available were more likely to use at least one blood pressure-lowering medicine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·23, 95\% CI 1·59–3·12); p{\textless}0·0001), combination therapy (1·53, 1·13–2·07; p=0·054), and have their blood pressure controlled (2·06, 1·69–2·50; p{\textless}0·0001) than were those in communities where blood pressure-lowering medicines were not available. Participants with known hypertension from households able to afford four blood pressure-lowering drug classes were more likely to use at least one blood pressure-lowering medicine (adjusted OR 1·42, 95\% CI 1·25–1·62; p{\textless}0·0001), combination therapy (1·26, 1·08–1·47; p=0·0038), and have their blood pressure controlled (1·13, 1·00–1·28; p=0·0562) than were those unable to afford the medicines. Interpretation A large proportion of communities in low-income and middle-income countries do not have access to more than one blood pressure-lowering medicine and, when available, they are often not affordable. These factors are associated with poor blood pressure control. Ensuring access to affordable blood pressure-lowering medicines is essential for control of hypertension in low-income and middle-income countries.

	abstract = {Background: The government of Ghana introduced the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2004 with the goal of achieving universal coverage within 5 years. Evidence, however, shows that expanding NHIS coverage and especially retaining members have remained a challenge. A multilevel perspective was employed as a conceptual framework and methodological tool to examine why enrolment and retention in the NHIS remains low. Methods: A household survey was conducted after 20 months educational and promotional activities aimed at improving enrolment and retention rates in 15 communities in the Central and Eastern Regions (ERs) of Ghana. Observation, in-depth interviews and informal conversations were used to collect qualitative data. Forty key informants (community members, health providers and district health insurance schemes’ [DHISs] staff) purposely selected from two case-study communities in the Central Region (CR) were interviewed. Several community members, health providers and DHISs’ staff were also engaged in informal conversations in the other five communities in the region. Also, four staff of the Ministry of Health (MoH), Ghana Health Service (GHS) and National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) were engaged in in-depth interviews. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse quantitative data. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic content analysis. Results: The results show that factors that influence enrolment and retention in the NHIS are multi-dimensional and cut across all stakeholders. People enrolled and renewed their membership because of NHIS’ benefits and health providers’ positive behaviour. Barriers to enrolment and retention included: poverty, traditional risk-sharing arrangements influence people to enrol or renew their membership only when they need healthcare, dissatisfaction about health providers’ behaviour and service delivery challenges. Conclusion: Given the multi-dimensional nature of barriers to enrolment and retention, we suggest that the NHIA should engage DHISs, health providers and other stakeholders to develop and implement intervention activities to eliminate corruption, shortage of drugs in health facilities and enforce the compulsory enrolment stated in the NHIS policy to move the scheme towards universal coverage.},

	abstract = {Background: Population ageing presents considerable challenges for the attainment of universal health coverage (UHC), especially in countries where such coverage is still in its infancy. Ghana presents an important case study on the effectiveness of policies aimed at achieving UHC in the context of population ageing in low and middle-income countries. It has witnessed a profound recent demographic transition, including a large increase in the number of older adults, which coincided with the development and implementation of a National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), designed to help achieve UHC. The objective of this paper is to examine the community, household and individual level determinants of NHIS enrolment among older adults aged 50-69 and 70 plus. The latter are exempt from NHIS premium payments. Methods: Using the Ghanaian Living Standards Survey from 2012 to 2013, determinants of NHIS enrolment for individuals aged 50-69 and 70 plus living in rural Ghana are examined through the application of multilevel regression analysis. Results: Previous studies have mainly focused on the enrolment of young and middle aged adults and considered mainly demographic and socio-economic factors. The novel inclusion of spatial barriers within this analysis demonstrates that levels of NHIS enrolment are determined in part by the community provision of healthcare facilities. In addition, the findings imply that insurance enrolment increases with household expenditure even for those aged 70 plus who are exempt from the NHIS premium payment. Conclusion: Adequate and appropriate infrastructure as well as health insurance is vital to ensure movement to UHC in low and middle income countries. Overall, the results confirm that there remain significant inequalities in enrolment by expenditure quintile that future policy reform will need to address.},
